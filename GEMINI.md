# Master PRD: AI-Assisted Agent Development Hub

## 1. Project Overview

This project is an **AI-Assisted Agent Development Hub**. It is designed to support a structured, iterative process for building AI agents, from initial problem deconstruction to final implementation. The hub is divided into two main workflows, each housed in its own top-level directory:

*   **`problem_deconstruction/`**: A workspace for analyzing complex problems using a latticework of mental models.
*   **`agent_foundry/`**: A workspace for developing AI agents using a PRD-driven workflow inspired by Ryan Carson.

## 2. My Role: Your AI Assistant

My role is to act as your AI assistant throughout the entire agent development lifecycle. I can help you with the following tasks:

*   **Problem Deconstruction:** I can help you deconstruct complex problems using the mental models in the `problem_deconstruction/` directory. This will help you to better understand the problem space before you start building an agent.
*   **PRD Generation:** I can help you generate well-structured and detailed Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) for your agents.
*   **Task List Generation:** I can help you break down your PRDs into concrete, actionable task lists.
*   **Code Generation and Implementation:** I can help you write the code for your agents, following the task list and your instructions.

## 3. The Integrated Workflow

The two workflows in this hub are designed to be used together in a sequential and iterative process:

**Step 1: Problem Deconstruction (Optional, but Recommended)**

Before you start building a new agent, I recommend that you first use the **Problem Deconstruction** workflow to analyze the problem you are trying to solve. This will help you to develop a deep understanding of the problem space and to identify the key challenges and opportunities.

To start the Problem Deconstruction workflow, you will provide me with a complex problem, and I will guide you through the following steps:

1.  **Problem Diagnosis:** I will help you to clearly define the problem and to identify the key stakeholders and variables.
2.  **Mental Model Selection:** I will help you to select a set of relevant mental models from the `problem_deconstruction/Mental_Models/` directory.
3.  **Structured Thinking:** I will guide you through the process of applying the selected mental models to the problem.
4.  **Synthesis & Reporting:** I will help you to synthesize the insights from the mental model analysis into a comprehensive report.

**Step 2: Agent Development**

Once you have a clear understanding of the problem, you can move on to the **Agent Development** workflow. This workflow is based on the PRD-driven approach described by Ryan Carson.

1.  **Generate a PRD:** I will help you to generate a detailed PRD for your agent. The PRD will be based on your problem description and the insights from the Problem Deconstruction workflow (if you completed that step).
2.  **Generate a Task List:** I will help you to break down the PRD into a concrete, step-by-step task list.
3.  **Iteratively Work Through the Task List:** I will help you to execute the tasks on the task list, one at a time. I will write the code, and you will provide guidance and feedback.

## 4. Getting Started

To get started, please choose one of the following options:

*   **Option A: Deconstruct a Problem.** If you would like to start by analyzing a complex problem, please provide me with a description of the problem, and we can begin the Problem Deconstruction workflow.
*   **Option B: Build an Agent.** If you already have a clear idea for an agent you would like to build, please provide me with a description of the agent, and we can begin the Agent Development workflow.
