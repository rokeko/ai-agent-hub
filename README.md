# AI-Assisted Agent Development Hub

This repository is a structured workspace for designing, developing, and deploying AI agents. It integrates two key workflows: **Problem Deconstruction** and **Agent Development**. This approach is designed to ensure that we build the *right* agents to solve well-understood problems.

## The Core Concepts

This hub is built on two core concepts:

1.  **Problem Deconstruction:** Before we build, we must understand. This workflow uses a latticework of **mental models** to deconstruct complex problems, ensuring that we have a deep and multi-faceted understanding of the challenge at hand.
2.  **Agent Development (The "Ryan Carson" Method):** This workflow uses a structured, PRD-driven approach to agent development. It is inspired by the methods of Ryan Carson, and it is designed to ensure that we build agents in a clear, iterative, and efficient manner.

## The Integrated Workflow

The two workflows are designed to be used together:

1.  **Start with Problem Deconstruction:** Before you start building a new agent, it is highly recommended that you first use the tools in the `problem_deconstruction` directory to analyze the problem you are trying to solve. This will help you to develop a deep understanding of the problem space and to identify the key challenges and opportunities.
2.  **Move to Agent Development:** Once you have a clear understanding of the problem, you can move on to the `agent_foundry` directory to begin the agent development process. The insights from the Problem Deconstruction workflow will provide a strong foundation for your PRD and will help to ensure that you build the right agent to solve the problem.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories:

*   **`problem_deconstruction/`**: This directory contains the tools and resources for analyzing complex problems.
    *   `Mental_Models/`: A collection of mental models that can be used to deconstruct problems.
    *   `WorkSpace/`: A workspace for saving the output of your problem deconstruction analyses.
    *   `Additional_Info/`: Supporting documentation and research.
*   **`agent_foundry/`**: This directory contains the tools and resources for developing AI agents.
    *   `01_docs/`: General notes and contextual summaries.
    *   `02_agent_prds/`: The main PRDs describing how your agents operate.
    *   `03_flow_sketches/`: LangFlow drafts, signal maps, or logic diagrams.
    *   `04_notebooks/`: Optional: JSON snippets, LangGraph workflows, or agent experiments.
    *   `05_templates/`: Slim PRD or AI prompt templates.
    *   `06_exports_obsidian/`: Final cleaned notes, ready to sync to an Obsidian Vault.

## Getting Started

To get started, please review the `GEMINI.md` file, which is the "master" PRD that governs our collaboration. It provides a detailed overview of the integrated workflow and explains how I can assist you with both problem deconstruction and agent development.
