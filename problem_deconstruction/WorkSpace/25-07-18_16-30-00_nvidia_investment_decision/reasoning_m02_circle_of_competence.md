### Thinking Steps Analysis

**1. Define Your Core Competencies:**
- You have stated that you have a good understanding of AI models. This is a valuable area of knowledge.
- However, understanding the application layer (AI models) is different from understanding the hardware and semiconductor layer where Nvidia operates.

**2. Define Your Boundaries:**
- You have been honest in assessing your knowledge of the semiconductor industry as low (3/10).
- You are also new to investing and have a low tolerance for risk.
- **Conclusion:** Based on your own assessment, investing in individual semiconductor stocks like Nvidia falls **outside** your current Circle of Competence.

**3. Operate Within the Circle:**
- The model strongly advises making high-stakes decisions squarely within your circle. A 25% portfolio allocation is a very high-stakes decision.
- The search results show that a proper analysis of Nvidia requires understanding:
    - Its different business segments (Data Center, Gaming, Auto).
    - The competitive advantages of its CUDA software ecosystem.
    - The serious and well-funded competitors (AMD, Intel, and the cloud giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft who are building their own chips).
    - The overall dynamics of the semiconductor industry.
- To invest confidently, you would need to have a strong opinion on why Nvidia's strategy will prevail against these formidable competitors. This requires deep industry knowledge.

**4. Expand the Circle Deliberately:**
- If you wish to make this investment, the responsible first step is to expand your circle of competence. This is not a quick process. It would involve:
    - **Reading Financials:** Analyzing Nvidia's annual (10-K) and quarterly (10-Q) reports.
    - **Understanding the Tech:** Learning about the differences between GPUs, CPUs, and custom ASICs (like Google's TPUs).
    - **Competitive Analysis:** Studying the products and strategies of AMD, Intel, and others.
- This level of research is necessary to move from "speculating" to "investing".

**5. Consult Experts:**
- By using this service, you are already consulting an expert.
- Another way to "consult experts" is to invest in a diversified manner. Instead of picking one company (a high-risk strategy), you could consider:
    - **Index Funds/ETFs:** An S&P 500 index fund would give you exposure to Nvidia as part of a broad market basket. A technology-focused ETF (like QQQ) would increase that exposure while still maintaining diversification across many tech companies.
    - This approach allows you to benefit from the growth of a sector without needing to become an expert on a single company, effectively "renting" the expertise of the fund managers and the market as a whole.

### Conclusion for this Model

The "Circle of Competence" model strongly advises **against** making a large, concentrated investment in Nvidia at this time, given your current knowledge level. The path forward is either to commit to the serious work of expanding your circle of competence or to choose an investment strategy (like diversification through ETFs) that does not require you to have expert-level knowledge of a single, complex company.
