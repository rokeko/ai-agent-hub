### Thinking Steps Analysis

**1. Identify the Influence:**
- Your starting point was that AI is a "hot topic." This is a clear signal that your interest is, at least in part, driven by the actions and opinions of the crowd. You are feeling the pull of Social Proof. It's a natural human tendency to become interested in what everyone else is interested in.

**2. Question the Crowd's Knowledge:**
- Does the crowd buying Nvidia stock possess deep, inside knowledge? Or are they, like many others, simply chasing performance?
- In a market mania, the crowd's "knowledge" is often just an awareness of the rising price. They are buying because it's going up. This is herd behavior, not collective wisdom. Many participants likely do not understand the nuances of the semiconductor industry, the competitive threats, or the valuation risks. They are following the trend.

**3. Think from First Principles:**
- Let's temporarily ignore the hype and the crowd. What are the objective facts for *your specific situation*?
    - **Fact:** Nvidia is a financially strong and innovative company.
    - **Fact:** Its stock is trading at a very high valuation, pricing in years of future growth.
    - **Fact:** You have a low understanding of the industry (3/10).
    - **Fact:** You have a low tolerance for financial loss (max 10%).
    - **Fact:** You are planning to invest a large portion of your portfolio (25%).
- Stripped of the social pressure, the rational conclusion based on these facts is that this is a high-risk investment that is not aligned with your personal risk profile or knowledge base.

**4. Seek Dissenting Opinions:**
- The crowd is shouting "Buy!" Who is saying "Be careful"?
    - **Value Investors:** Those who follow a discipline of buying companies for less than their intrinsic value would argue the stock is far too expensive.
    - **Market Historians:** They would point to previous bubbles (the dot-com crash of 2000, for example) where dominant, exciting companies still saw their stock prices fall 80% or more.
    - **Competitors:** AMD, Intel, Google, and Amazon are not standing still. They are actively working to take market share from Nvidia.
- Listening to these dissenting views provides a vital reality check against the herd's enthusiasm.

**5. Act Independently:**
- The core lesson of the Social Proof model is to have the courage to think for yourself. The analysis from the previous steps suggests that the independent, rational choice for you is to abstain from this specific investment.
- While it can be psychologically difficult to watch from the sidelines, the potential cost of joining the herd at the wrong time—a significant financial loss—is far greater than the emotional cost of missing out on potential further gains. Your primary goal is wealth preservation and steady growth, not speculation.

### Conclusion for this Model

The "Social Proof" model reveals that the desire to invest in Nvidia is heavily influenced by the actions and excitement of the crowd. This is a powerful psychological bias that often leads to poor investment decisions. By thinking from first principles and considering dissenting opinions, it becomes clear that for your specific situation, following the herd would be a high-risk action that contradicts your stated goals and risk tolerance.
