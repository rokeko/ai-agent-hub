The user is contemplating whether to invest in Nvidia (NVDA) at its current market position. The question is driven by the high public interest and growth in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) sector, where Nvidia is a key player.

**User Profile:**
*   **Investment Horizon:** 1-2 years (short-term)
*   **Risk Tolerance:** Low (max 10% loss)
*   **Understanding of Nvidia/Semiconductor Industry:** Low (3/10)
*   **Proposed Investment Size:** 25% of total portfolio
*   **Primary Goal:** Building long-term wealth (contradicts short-term horizon)

**Core Dilemma:**
The user's goal of long-term wealth is at odds with their short investment horizon and low-risk tolerance. Investing a significant portion (25%) of their portfolio in a high-volatility stock like Nvidia, in an industry they don't deeply understand, presents a high-risk scenario. The analysis must address this fundamental misalignment.
