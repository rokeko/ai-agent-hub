### Rationale for Selection

**1. Model: Circle of Competence (`m02_circle_of_competence.md`)**
*   **Reason:** This is the top-ranked model because the user explicitly rated their understanding of Nvidia's industry at a low "3 out of 10". This model directly confronts the primary risk factor in this scenario: making a significant investment in an area one does not deeply understand. It forces an honest self-assessment of knowledge boundaries before any market analysis can even begin.

**2. Model: Bubbles (`m59_bubbles.md`)**
*   **Reason:** The user's query is driven by Nvidia being a "hot topic" in AI. This model is essential for dissecting the current market sentiment. Its "Thinking Steps" provide a clear framework to analyze whether Nvidia's current stock price is grounded in fundamental value or is being inflated by speculative enthusiasm and a "fear of missing out" (FOMO), which is a critical risk for any investor in this situation.

**3. Model: Social Proof (`m84_social_proof_safety_in_numbers.md`)**
*   **Reason:** This model was chosen as a crucial psychological lens to complement the "Bubbles" model. It directly addresses *why* the user is asking the question nowâ€”because "everyone" is talking about it. The model's framework is designed to dismantle the powerful cognitive bias of herd behavior, encouraging the user to differentiate between a popular idea and a good investment. It helps to answer the question: "Am I considering this because it's a sound investment, or because everyone else is doing it?"
