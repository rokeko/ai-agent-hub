# Mental Models Selected

This file documents the selection process and outcome for the mental models applied to the problem of finding a solution to the Ukrainian war.

## Selection Funnel

From an initial list of over 30 candidate models, 6 were deeply evaluated, and the final 3 were selected.

## Final, Ranked List of Chosen Models

1.  **Trade-offs**
2.  **Second-Order Thinking**
3.  **Asymmetric Warfare**

## Rationale for Selection

*   **1. Trade-offs:** This model was chosen as the primary framework for this analysis due to the central contradiction in the user's stated goals. The user desires both a return to the "pre-war status quo" and a willingness to "trade land" for a fast resolution. The Trade-offs model will force a clear-eyed assessment of the inherent compromises and competing values at play in this conflict. It directly addresses the user's need to clarify their priorities and understand that they cannot have everything they want.

*   **2. Second-Order Thinking:** This model was selected to address the user's desire for a "quick fix" and to ensure that the analysis considers the long-term consequences of any proposed solution. The conflict in Ukraine is a complex system, and any intervention will have numerous ripple effects. Second-Order Thinking will provide a framework for anticipating these effects and for avoiding unintended and potentially disastrous outcomes.

*   **3. Asymmetric Warfare:** This model was chosen to provide a realistic understanding of the military dynamics of the conflict. The war in Ukraine is a classic example of asymmetric warfare, with the two sides having vastly different capabilities, strategies, and objectives. This model will provide a framework for analyzing the strategic calculations of both Russia and Ukraine, and for understanding the military realities on the ground.
