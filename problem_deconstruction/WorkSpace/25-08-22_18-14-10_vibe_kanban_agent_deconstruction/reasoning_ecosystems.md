# Reasoning: Ecosystems

This document applies the "Ecosystems" mental model to the problem of building the "Vibe Kanban" agent.

## Thinking Steps

**1. Map the System:**

The "Vibe Kanban" ecosystem is composed of the following key players and components:

*   **The User:** The user is the central actor in the ecosystem. They are the one who creates the content, manages the Kanban board, and ultimately benefits from the automated workflow.
*   **Obsidian:** This is the user's personal knowledge management system. It is the source of all content for the ecosystem.
*   **Gemini CLI:** This is the user's AI assistant. It is used to research and to generate content.
*   **The "Vibe Kanban" Agent:** This is the agent that we will build. It is the heart of the ecosystem, and it is responsible for automating the workflow.
*   **The Kanban Board:** This is a web-based tool that is used to visualize and to manage the user's workflow. It is inspired by Vibe Kanban, and it will be integrated with the user's Squarespace website.
*   **Squarespace:** This is the user's content management system. It is used to publish the final content to the web.

**2. Identify the Connections:**

The components of the ecosystem are connected in the following ways:

*   **User -> Obsidian:** The user creates and edits content in their Obsidian vault.
*   **User -> Gemini CLI:** The user uses the Gemini CLI to research and to generate content.
*   **Gemini CLI -> Obsidian:** The output of the Gemini CLI is saved to the user's Obsidian vault.
*   **Obsidian -> "Vibe Kanban" Agent:** The agent monitors the user's Obsidian vault for changes.
*   **"Vibe Kanban" Agent -> Kanban Board:** The agent updates the Kanban board with the latest content from the user's Obsidian vault.
*   **"Vibe Kanban" Agent -> Squarespace:** The agent publishes the final content to the user's Squarespace website.

**3. Look for Feedback Loops:**

There are several important feedback loops in this ecosystem:

*   **Content Creation Loop:** The user creates content in Obsidian, which is then processed by the agent and published to the Kanban board and the Squarespace website. This creates a feedback loop that allows the user to see the results of their work and to make adjustments as needed.
*   **Cost Tracking Loop:** The agent tracks the costs associated with the user's workflow and displays them on the Kanban board. This creates a feedback loop that allows the user to monitor their spending and to make adjustments as needed.

**4. Consider Second- and Third-Order Effects:**

A change to one part of the system can have ripple effects throughout the ecosystem. For example:

*   **A change to the Squarespace API** could break the agent's ability to publish content to the user's website.
*   **A change to the user's workflow** could require a change to the agent's logic.
*   **The introduction of a new tool** could create new opportunities for automation and integration.

**5. Intervene with Caution:**

When we build the "Vibe Kanban" agent, we should do so with caution. We should start with a small, simple solution and then iterate and to expand it over time. We should also be prepared to adapt the solution as the user's needs and the ecosystem evolve.

This analysis, based on the "Ecosystems" mental model, provides a holistic view of the "Vibe Kanban" project. It highlights the interconnectedness of the different parts of the system and the importance of considering the system as a whole when we design and to build the solution.
