# Mental Models Selected

This file documents the selection process and outcome for the mental models applied to the problem of building the "Vibe Kanban" agent.

## Selection Funnel

From an initial list of over 20 candidate models, 6 were deeply evaluated, and the final 3 were selected.

## Final, Ranked List of Chosen Models

1.  **Ecosystems**
2.  **Bottlenecks**
3.  **Framing**

## Rationale for Selection

*   **1. Ecosystems:** This model was chosen as the primary framework for this analysis because the user is describing a complex digital ecosystem with several interconnected parts: Obsidian, the Gemini CLI, a Kanban board, and a Squarespace website. Understanding how these parts interact with each other will be crucial to building a successful solution. This model will help us to think about the system as a whole and to design a solution that is robust, resilient, and adaptable.

*   **2. Bottlenecks:** This model was selected to ensure that the solution is efficient and scalable. In any system, there are bottlenecks that limit the overall throughput. In this case, the bottlenecks could be the user's time, the speed of the Gemini CLI, or the Squarespace API. This model will provide a framework for identifying and addressing these bottlenecks, ensuring that the final solution is as efficient as possible.

*   **3. Framing:** This model was chosen to address the user's desire for a visually appealing and engaging solution. The user has a clear vision for the aesthetic of the "Vibe Kanban" board, and the Framing model will provide a framework for thinking about how to best present the information on the Kanban board and the Squarespace website. This model will help us to design a solution that is not just functional, but also beautiful and engaging.
