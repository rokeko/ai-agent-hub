# Reasoning: Bottlenecks

This document applies the "Bottlenecks" mental model to the problem of building the "Vibe Kanban" agent.

## Thinking Steps

**1. Map the Process Flow:**

The "Vibe Kanban" process flow can be visualized as follows:

1.  **Content Creation:** The user creates and edits content in their Obsidian vault.
2.  **AI-Assisted Research and Generation:** The user uses the Gemini CLI to research and to generate content, which is then saved to the Obsidian vault.
3.  **Content Ingestion:** The "Vibe Kanban" agent monitors the Obsidian vault for changes and ingests the new or updated content.
4.  **Content Transformation:** The agent transforms the ingested content into a visually appealing format for the Kanban board and the Squarespace website.
5.  **Kanban Board Update:** The agent updates the Kanban board with the transformed content.
6.  **Squarespace Publication:** The agent publishes the final content to the user's Squarespace website.

**2. Identify the Constraint:**

Based on this process flow, we can identify several potential bottlenecks:

*   **Content Creation:** The user's time and creativity are the ultimate constraints on the system. The entire workflow depends on the user creating new content.
*   **AI-Assisted Research and Generation:** The speed and quality of the Gemini CLI's output could be a bottleneck. If the CLI is slow or produces low-quality content, it will slow down the entire workflow.
*   **Content Ingestion:** The process of monitoring the Obsidian vault for changes could be a bottleneck. If the agent is not able to detect changes in a timely manner, it will delay the entire workflow.
*   **Content Transformation:** The process of transforming the ingested content into a visually appealing format could be a bottleneck. This is especially true if the transformation process is complex or computationally expensive.
*   **API Rate Limits:** The Squarespace and Trello APIs both have rate limits that could be a bottleneck. If the agent makes too many requests to these APIs in a short period of time, it will be throttled, which will slow down the entire workflow.

**3. Exploit the Bottleneck:**

We can exploit these bottlenecks in the following ways:

*   **Content Creation:** We can provide the user with tools and templates that make it easier for them to create high-quality content.
*   **AI-Assisted Research and Generation:** We can design the agent to work asynchronously, so that the user is not blocked while the Gemini CLI is processing a request.
*   **Content Ingestion:** We can use a file system watcher to monitor the Obsidian vault for changes, which will be more efficient than polling the file system at regular intervals.
*   **Content Transformation:** We can use a templating engine to separate the content from the presentation, which will make it easier to create and to maintain the visual design of the Kanban board and the Squarespace website.
*   **API Rate Limits:** We can design the agent to be mindful of the API rate limits and to back off when it detects that it is being throttled.

**4. Subordinate Everything Else:**

The speed of the entire system should be paced to the speed of the bottlenecks. For example, there is no point in the agent ingesting content faster than it can be transformed and published.

**5. Elevate the Bottleneck:**

If we have fully exploited the bottlenecks and still need more throughput, we can invest in improving them. For example:

*   We could upgrade to a more powerful version of the Gemini CLI.
*   We could use a more efficient templating engine.
*   We could request a higher rate limit from Squarespace or Trello.

**6. Repeat:**

Once a bottleneck is elevated, a new constraint will appear elsewhere. We will need to repeat this process of identifying and elevating bottlenecks to continuously improve the performance of the system.

This analysis, based on the "Bottlenecks" mental model, provides a framework for designing a "Vibe Kanban" agent that is as efficient and as scalable as possible. It highlights the importance of identifying and addressing the constraints in the system, and it provides a set of strategies for doing so.
