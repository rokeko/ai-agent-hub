# Questionnaire: Vibe Kanban Agent

To help me to better understand your vision for the "Vibe Kanban" agent, please answer the following questions. Your responses will help us to select the most relevant mental models for our analysis and to ensure that we build the right agent to solve the problem.

1.  **Kanban Board:** Which Kanban board would you like to use for this project? (e.g., Trello, GitHub Projects, a simple Markdown file, or something else?)

2.  **Content:** What kind of content do you envision posting to your Squarespace website? Are we talking about short status updates, long-form articles, or something else? What information would be included in the Kanban card to generate the post?

3.  **Automation:** How much automation are you looking for in this workflow? Do you want the agent to post directly to your website, or would you prefer to have a draft created for your review?

4.  **Metrics:** You mentioned tracking metrics like "tokens spent." What other metrics would you be interested in tracking and displaying in the blog posts?

5.  **"Sexy" Factor:** You mentioned that you want the solution to be "lean but sexy." Can you tell me more about what that means to you? What would make this solution feel "sexy" to you?

Please edit this file with your answers to these questions. Your responses will be crucial in shaping the analysis that follows.
