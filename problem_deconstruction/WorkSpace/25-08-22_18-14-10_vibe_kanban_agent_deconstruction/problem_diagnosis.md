# Problem Diagnosis: Vibe Kanban Agent (Updated)

The user wants to build a "Vibe Kanban" agent that can automate the process of posting content from a Kanban board to a Squarespace website.

## Core Problem

The core problem is to create a seamless, automated content pipeline from the user's Obsidian vault to a visually rich, web-based Kanban board integrated with a Squarespace website.

## User's Vision

*   **Kanban Board:** A web-based, visually appealing Kanban board, inspired by Vibe Kanban (https://www.vibekanban.com/), and potentially integrated directly into the user's Squarespace site (https://www.c-vibes.com/).
*   **Content Source:** The user's Obsidian vault will be the single source of truth. Changes in Obsidian should be reflected on the Kanban board/website.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  The user works on text in Obsidian.
    2.  The user uses the Gemini CLI for research and analysis.
    3.  The output from the Gemini CLI is saved to a specific folder.
    4.  The Kanban board/website automatically pulls and displays the latest content from that output folder.
*   **Metrics:** The user wants to track costs, including Gemini CLI usage, Google Workspace, and Squarespace fees.
*   **Aesthetic:** The initial focus is on a rich, visually engaging experience, with a longer-term goal of a "lean but sexy," minimalist, black-and-white mobile experience.

## Key Challenges

*   **Obsidian Integration:** The agent will need to be able to monitor the user's Obsidian vault for changes to files.
*   **Dynamic Content Generation:** The agent will need to be able to take the content from the user's Obsidian vault and the output from the Gemini CLI and to transform it into a well-formatted and visually appealing Kanban board and blog posts.
*   **Squarespace Integration:** The agent will need to be able to connect to the Squarespace API and to create and to update content on the user's website.
*   **Cost Tracking:** The agent will need to be able to track the costs associated with the user's workflow, including Gemini CLI usage, Google Workspace fees, and Squarespace fees.
*   **Authentication and Security:** The agent will need to be able to securely authenticate with the user's Obsidian vault, the Gemini CLI, and the Squarespace API.
*   **User Experience:** The user will need a simple and intuitive way to configure and to manage the agent.

## Desired Outcome

The desired outcome is a fully automated workflow that can take content from the user's Obsidian vault and the output from the Gemini CLI and to publish it as a visually rich and engaging Kanban board and blog posts on a Squarespace website, with minimal user intervention.
