# Reasoning: Framing

This document applies the "Framing" mental model to the problem of building the "Vibe Kanban" agent.

## Thinking Steps

**1. Identify the Core Message:**

The core message of the "Vibe Kanban" is that it is a tool for **effortless, AI-assisted content creation and publication.** It is a system that allows the user to move seamlessly from idea to published content, with a focus on a rich, visual experience.

**2. Determine the Desired Perception:**

We want the user to perceive the "Vibe Kanban" as:

*   **Powerful:** A tool that can automate a complex workflow and provide a high degree of leverage.
*   **Beautiful:** A tool that is visually appealing and engaging.
*   **Effortless:** A tool that is easy and intuitive to use.
*   **Insightful:** A tool that provides valuable insights into the user's workflow and costs.

**3. Choose the Frame:**

We will use a combination of frames to shape the user's perception of the "Vibe Kanban":

*   **The "Vibe Coding" Frame:** We will borrow the concept of "Vibe Coding" from Vibe Kanban and apply it to the user's content creation workflow. This frame emphasizes the idea of a smooth, intuitive, and almost effortless experience.
*   **The "Control Room" Frame:** We will frame the Kanban board as a "control room" for the user's content creation pipeline. This frame emphasizes the idea of a centralized and powerful tool that gives the user a high degree of visibility and control over their workflow.
*   **The "Lean but Sexy" Frame:** We will use this frame to guide the design of the mobile experience. This frame emphasizes the idea of a minimalist and elegant interface that prioritizes the most essential information.

**4. Define the Boundaries:**

We will intentionally leave the following out of the frame:

*   **Complexity:** We will hide the complexity of the underlying system from the user. The user should not have to worry about the details of how the agent works; they should only have to interact with a simple and intuitive interface.
*   **Technical Jargon:** We will avoid using technical jargon in the user interface. The language should be clear, concise, and easy to understand.

**5. Test the Frame:**

We will test the frame by building a prototype of the "Vibe Kanban" and getting feedback from the user. We will pay close attention to the user's emotional and intellectual response to the prototype, and we will be prepared to adjust the frame based on their feedback.

This analysis, based on the "Framing" mental model, provides a set of design principles for the "Vibe Kanban" agent. It highlights the importance of shaping the user's perception of the system and provides a set of strategies for doing so. By carefully framing the "Vibe Kanban" as a powerful, beautiful, and effortless tool, we can create a solution that is not just functional, but also delightful to use.
