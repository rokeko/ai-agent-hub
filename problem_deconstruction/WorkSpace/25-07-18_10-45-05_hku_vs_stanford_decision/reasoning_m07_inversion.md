# Reasoning with Inversion

Applying the "Inversion" model to the HKU vs. Stanford decision.

## 1. Clearly Define Your Goal

My goal is to have a successful and fulfilling university experience that leads to a great career in tech, without being derailed by geopolitical events.

## 2. Invert the Problem

How could I guarantee a disastrous outcome?
*   I end up with a degree that is not respected.
*   I am unable to get a job in my desired field or location.
*   My university experience is miserable and I fail to build a network.
*   I am forced to leave my chosen country of study against my will.
*   My personal safety or freedom is compromised.

## 3. Brainstorm All Potential Failure Points

**Failure Path 1: Choose Stanford and Ruin Everything**

*   **Visa Hell:** I graduate, but fail the H-1B lottery year after year. My OPT expires, and I'm forced to leave the US. My expensive, prestigious degree and US-based network are now largely useless for a career in China, where I have no recent connections.
*   **Geopolitical Fallout:** US-China relations deteriorate further. The US government becomes more hostile to Chinese nationals, making it difficult to find internships or jobs. I face suspicion and discrimination. Collaboration with Chinese companies or universities becomes impossible.
*   **Social Isolation:** I fail to connect with the campus culture, feel isolated and alone, and don't build the friendships and network that are important to me. The high-pressure environment leads to burnout.

**Failure Path 2: Choose HKU and Ruin Everything**

*   **Erosion of Freedoms:** The political situation in Hong Kong worsens dramatically. Academic freedom is completely curtailed, and the curriculum becomes heavily politicized. The internet is restricted. I live in a climate of fear and cannot express myself.
*   **Devaluation of Degree:** As Hong Kong's autonomy erodes, the international reputation of HKU plummets. My degree is seen as being from a "Chinese" university, but without the direct connections of a mainland institution. It loses its prestige in the West.
*   **Tech Hub Collapse:** The geopolitical tensions cause an exodus of international companies from Hong Kong. The city's role as a tech hub diminishes, and the job opportunities I was counting on disappear. I am stuck in a city with a declining economy and limited prospects.

## 4. Create an "Avoidance List"

Based on the above, I must avoid:

*   **Path A (Stanford Risk):** A situation where my ability to remain in the country post-graduation is entirely dependent on a lottery.
*   **Path B (HKU Risk):** A situation where my personal freedoms and the value of my education are at risk due to political changes.

## 5. Focus on Not Being Stupid

The inverted analysis clarifies the two major risks:
1.  **The Stanford path's primary risk is post-graduation uncertainty.** The education and experience are world-class, but the path to a long-term career in the US is fraught with visa risks.
2.  **The HKU path's primary risk is political and existential.** The risk is not just about a job, but about the fundamental environment in which you will live and study.

Given your risk aversion score of 2/5, the HKU path appears to carry a more fundamental and less controllable risk. The potential for political instability and the erosion of freedoms is a "fat-tail" risk that is difficult to mitigate. The Stanford risk, while significant, is more of a logistical and career challenge that can be planned for (e.g., by also networking with companies that have a global presence).
