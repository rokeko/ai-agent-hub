# Reasoning with Trade-offs & Opportunity Cost

Applying the "Trade-offs & Opportunity Cost" model to the HKU vs. Stanford decision.

## 1. Identify the Core Decision

Choose between a Bachelor's in Computer Science at HKU or Stanford.

## 2. List All Viable Options

*   **Option A:** Attend Stanford University.
*   **Option B:** Attend Hong Kong University.

## 3. For Each Option, Define the Gains

*   **Gains of Choosing Stanford:**
    *   **Unparalleled Prestige:** A degree from Stanford is a globally recognized symbol of excellence in computer science.
    *   **Silicon Valley Proximity:** Direct access to the world's leading tech ecosystem for internships, networking, and cutting-edge innovation.
    *   **Top-Tier US Network:** Building a network of peers and mentors who will likely be leaders in the US tech industry.
    *   **Entrepreneurial Culture:** Immersion in a culture that encourages and supports startups and risk-taking.

*   **Gains of Choosing HKU:**
    *   **Gateway to Asia:** A strong foothold in the Asian tech market, particularly mainland China.
    *   **Regional Expertise:** Developing a deep understanding of the Asian tech landscape and business culture.
    *   **International City:** Living in a vibrant, global city with a unique blend of cultures.
    *   **Lower Political Risk (in some aspects):** Less direct exposure to the immediate friction of US-China tensions for students on campus.

## 4. Identify the Opportunity Cost

*   **Opportunity Cost of Choosing Stanford:**
    *   You are giving up the opportunity to build a deep, early-career network in the rapidly growing Asian tech market.
    *   You are sacrificing the chance to become a "bridge" candidate with deep roots in both the Western and Asian tech worlds from the start.
    *   You are choosing a path with significant post-graduation visa uncertainty.

*   **Opportunity Cost of Choosing HKU:**
    *   You are giving up the unparalleled prestige and brand recognition of a Stanford degree.
    *   You are sacrificing direct access to the Silicon Valley ecosystem and its unique concentration of talent and capital.
    *   You are choosing a path with significant political uncertainty that could impact your academic freedom and the long-term value of your degree.

## 5. Align with Priorities

*   **Career Goals:** You want to work for a top tech company like Google, which has a major presence in both the US and Asia. Both paths could lead to this goal, but the nature of the journey would be different. Stanford offers a more direct, but potentially fragile, path to a US-based role. HKU offers a more direct path to an Asia-based role.
*   **Personal Priorities:** You value making friends and having a good university experience. This is highly dependent on the specific campus culture and your personal fit. However, the political climate in Hong Kong presents a clear risk to the social and academic environment.
*   **Risk Tolerance:** You are risk-averse (2/5). The risks associated with HKU (political instability, erosion of freedoms) are systemic and largely outside of your control. The risks associated with Stanford (visa lottery) are more procedural and, while significant, can be mitigated with planning.

## 6. Make a Deliberate Choice

The trade-off is between the **higher prestige and opportunity of Stanford** versus the **more direct access to the Asian market of HKU**.

However, the opportunity costs are not symmetrical for a risk-averse person.
*   The opportunity cost of choosing Stanford is primarily a **career strategy cost**.
*   The opportunity cost of choosing HKU is a **fundamental environmental and political risk**.

Given your low-risk tolerance, sacrificing the direct access to the Asian market (the opportunity cost of choosing Stanford) is likely a more acceptable trade-off than sacrificing your peace of mind and the stability of your educational environment (the opportunity cost of choosing HKU).
