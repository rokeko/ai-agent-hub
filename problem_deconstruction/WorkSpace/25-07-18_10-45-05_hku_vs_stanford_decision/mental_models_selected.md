# Mental Model Selection

From an initial list of over 90 candidate models, a smaller pool of 6 was deeply evaluated, and the final 3 were selected for this analysis. The selection was based on the user's specific problem of choosing between HKU and Stanford amidst geopolitical uncertainty, their risk-averse nature, and their career goals.

## Final Ranked List of Chosen Models

1.  **Second-Order Thinking**
2.  **Inversion**
3.  **Trade-offs & Opportunity Cost**

## Rationale for Selection

*   **Second-Order Thinking:** Chosen because its `Thinking Steps` are ideal for exploring the long-term, "and then what?" consequences of a major life decision. This directly addresses the user's concern about the future implications of the US-China tensions on their career and life.

*   **Inversion:** Selected due to the user's self-professed risk aversion (2/5). The model's core question, "What could cause me to fail?", is the perfect tool to address their fear of things going wrong. By focusing on avoiding disastrous outcomes, we can choose the safest path forward.

*   **Trade-offs & Opportunity Cost:** This model is essential for any decision involving multiple attractive options. Its framework for identifying what is being given up (the opportunity cost) will bring clarity to the decision. It forces a conscious evaluation of what the user is gaining and sacrificing with either choice, ensuring the final decision aligns with their stated priorities.
