## Mental Model = Two-Front War

**Category = Warfare & Strategy**
**Description:** 
A two-front war occurs when a single entity is forced to fight two separate opponents, or address two major, distinct challenges, at the same time. The core insight is that this splits resources, attention, and focus, weakening the ability to succeed on either front. The goal is nearly always to avoid fighting a two-front war yourself, while potentially seeking to force one upon an adversary.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **This is a model of a situation to be AVOIDED.** The primary use of this model is as a warning. Actively avoid putting yourself or your organization into a two-front war.
- **Don't Underestimate an Opponent:** Attempting to force a two-front war on a competitor can be a powerful strategy, but if they have sufficient resources, it may not be effective and could backfire.
- **Internal vs. External:** The most common two-front war for an organization is battling external competitors while also fighting internal dysfunction or political battles.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Identify Your Fronts:** List all the major challenges or opponents you are currently facing. Are you fighting a key competitor while also dealing with a major internal crisis? That's a two-front war.
2. **Assess the Resource Drain:** Quantify the attention, capital, and energy being consumed by each front. Be honest about the cost of dividing your focus.
3. **Prioritize Ruthlessly:** You cannot give 100% to both fronts. Decide which front is more critical to your long-term survival and success.
4. **Seek to Close a Front:** Can you achieve a truce or resolution on one front? Can you solve the internal issue quickly to focus on the external threat? Or can you delay a confrontation with one competitor?
5. **If Unavoidable, Allocate Deliberately:** If you must fight on two fronts, do not try to achieve overwhelming victory on both simultaneously. Allocate just enough resources to hold one front stable while you seek a decisive victory on the other.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "Are we currently fighting a war on two or more fronts? What are they?"
- "Which of these challenges poses the greatest existential threat to us?"
- "What internal conflicts are draining energy that should be aimed at our competitors?"
- "Can we declare a temporary truce in one area to allow us to win in another?"
- "How are we actively trying to force our main competitor into a two-front war?"
