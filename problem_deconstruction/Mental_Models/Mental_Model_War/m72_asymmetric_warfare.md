## Mental Model = Asymmetric Warfare

**Category = Warfare & Business Strategy**
**Description:** 
Asymmetric warfare describes a conflict where two sides have vastly different resources, strategies, and goals. The weaker side, unable to compete on conventional terms, leverages its unique advantages—like speed, local knowledge, or a higher tolerance for risk—to exploit the stronger opponent's weaknesses. Instead of a head-on-battle, it "plays by different rules," using tactics like guerrilla warfare, disruptive innovation, or targeted marketing to achieve a disproportionate impact.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When It Erodes Ethical Grounding:** Asymmetric tactics can involve deception and subversion. If these tactics violate your core ethical principles or alienate key stakeholders, they can cause long-term reputational damage that outweighs short-term gains.
- **When You Are the Incumbent:** If you are the larger, more established entity, adopting asymmetric tactics can seem hypocritical or dishonorable, potentially damaging morale and public trust.
- **When It Leads to Escalation:** An unconventional attack can provoke an overwhelming, disproportionate response from the stronger power, leading to a worse outcome.

**Keywords for Situations:**
Startup competition, disruptive innovation, guerrilla marketing, cybersecurity, insurgency, negotiations, social movements.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Analyze the Imbalance:** Clearly identify the core asymmetries. What resources, rules, and assumptions favor your opponent? What unique advantages do you possess?
2. **Identify the Opponent's Center of Gravity vs. Your Own:** What is most critical to them (e.g., reputation, a specific product line, public confidence)? What is most critical to you (e.g., survival, user growth)?
3. **Define Different Rules:** Brainstorm unconventional tactics that sidestep your opponent's strengths and target their vulnerabilities. Think about what they would least expect.
4. **Execute with Speed and Surprise:** Asymmetric tactics rely on agility. Act quickly and decisively before the larger opponent can adapt or respond effectively.
5. **Control the Narrative:** Shape the perception of the conflict. Use propaganda, PR, or social media to frame your actions in a favorable light and your opponent's in a negative one.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "What if we refuse to fight on their terms? What would that look like?"
- "What are the 'unwritten rules' in our industry, and what happens if we break them?"
- "How can we use our small size and speed as a weapon?"
- "Where is our opponent most vulnerable to a surprise attack?"
- "How can we achieve a massive psychological impact with a minimal resource investment?"
