## Mental Model = Social Proof

**Category = Human Nature & Judgment**
**Description:** 
Social Proof is the deep-seated psychological tendency to assume that the actions of others reflect the correct behavior for a given situation. When we are uncertain, we look to the crowd for guidance. This instinct for conformity allows for social cohesion and cooperation, but it can also lead to herd behavior, investment bubbles, and the bystander effect, where everyone assumes someone else will act.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **In Financial Markets:** Herd behavior is a primary driver of bubbles and crashes. The fact that "everyone" is buying an asset is often a warning sign of a mania, not a signal of a good investment.
- **When Judging New Ideas:** Popularity is not a proxy for quality. Many great ideas are unpopular at first, and many bad ideas become fads through social proof. Don't mistake consensus for correctness.
- **In Emergency or Ambiguous Situations:** Social proof can lead to the "bystander effect," where individuals in a crowd fail to act because they see others doing nothing and incorrectly infer that the situation is not an emergency.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Identify the Influence:** Recognize when your judgment or decision is being swayed by the actions or opinions of a larger group.
2. **Question the Crowd's Knowledge:** Ask yourself, "Do these people have superior information, or are they just copying each other?" In many manias, everyone is just looking at everyone else.
3. **Think from First Principles:** Temporarily ignore the actions of others. Based on the objective facts available to you, what is the rational course of action?
4. **Seek Dissenting Opinions:** Find the person who is not following the herd and understand their reasoning. The dissenting view is often the most valuable.
5. **Act Independently:** If you determine the crowd is wrong, you must have the courage to act independently. The cost of being wrong with the herd is often higher than the cost of being right alone.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "Is this a genuinely good idea, or is it just a popular idea right now?"
- "What evidence do we have besides the fact that 'everyone else is doing it'?"
- "If we were the only company in the world looking at this, would we still make this same decision?"
- "Is this a signal of genuine market demand, or are we just observing herd behavior?"
- "Let's assume for a moment that the entire crowd is mistaken. What would that look like?"
