## Mental Model = Tendency to Feel Envy & Jealousy

**Category = Human Nature & Judgment**
**Description:** 
Envy is the painful feeling of wanting what someone else has. Jealousy is the fear of losing what you have to someone else. These are powerful, primal emotions that are deeply wired into human nature. They can drive otherwise irrational behavior, from self-destructive acts to destabilizing entire organizations, as people's sense of fairness and relative status is violated.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When Designing Incentive Systems:** Any system of compensation or promotion that is perceived as opaque or unfair will breed envy and resentment, which can destroy morale and productivity.
- **When Consuming Social Media:** Be aware that platforms like Instagram and LinkedIn are engines for generating envy by showcasing curated, often unrealistic, versions of others' lives and successes.
- **In Team Dynamics:** When assigning credit or rewards, be mindful of how perceptions of favoritism or unfairness can trigger envy and undermine collaboration.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Acknowledge the Emotion:** Recognize the feeling of envy or jealousy in yourself without judgment. It's a natural human response.
2. **Identify the Trigger:** Pinpoint the specific comparison that is causing the emotion. What, exactly, do you covet?
3. **Reframe from Comparison to Your Own Path:** Shift your focus from what others have to your own goals and progress. The key question is not "Am I doing better than them?" but "Am I doing better than I was yesterday?"
4. **Anticipate Envy in Systems:** When designing any system that allocates resources or status (e.g., compensation, promotions), prioritize procedural fairness and transparency. Unequal outcomes are more easily accepted if the process is seen as fair.
5. **Address the Underlying Feeling:** When you observe envy in others, look past the complaint to the underlying feeling of unfairness or being undervalued.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "Is our strategy being driven by our own goals or by a desire to 'beat' a competitor out of envy?"
- "How might this new compensation plan be perceived by employees? Where are the potential envy hotspots?"
- "Are we making this decision to be fair, or to be equal? What's the difference in this context?"
- "Is my negative reaction to this person's success about them, or is it about my own insecurities?"
- "Instead of looking at what they have, what is the next productive step on our own path?"
