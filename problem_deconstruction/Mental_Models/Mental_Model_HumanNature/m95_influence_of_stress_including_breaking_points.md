## Mental Model = Influence of Stress

**Category = Human Nature & Judgment**
**Description:** 
Stress, both acute and chronic, fundamentally degrades our ability to think rationally. It triggers a physiological "fight-or-flight" response, causing our thinking to become more simplistic, short-term, and reliant on instinct and habit. Under stress, all our other cognitive biases become more pronounced. As the military saying goes, "You do not rise to the level of your expectations, you fall to the level of your training."

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When Making High-Stakes Decisions:** Never make a major, irreversible decision when you are under significant stress, sleep-deprived, or emotionally overwhelmed. Your judgment is compromised.
- **In Crisis Management:** The very nature of a crisis induces stress, which narrows focus and encourages hasty decisions. The most important thing to do in a crisis is often to slow down, not speed up.
- **In Personal Health and Finance:** Chronic stress leads to poor long-term decisions. It encourages seeking immediate relief (unhealthy food, impulsive spending) at the expense of long-term well-being.

**Keywords for Situations:** 
Crisis management, high-stakes negotiation, burnout, decision fatigue, emergency situations, fight-or-flight.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Recognize the Signs of Stress:** Identify the physiological and mental indicators that you are operating under duress (e.g., shallow breathing, irritability, tunnel vision, racing thoughts).
2. **Do Not Decide Now:** If possible, postpone any important decision until you are in a calmer state. The first step is to simply not act.
3. **Fall Back on Training and Checklists:** In situations where you must act under stress, rely on pre-prepared plans, checklists, and heuristics. Do not try to reason from first principles in a crisis.
4. **Build in Buffers and Circuit Breakers:** Proactively design systems that prevent you from making stress-induced errors. Examples include mandatory waiting periods for major decisions or automatic savings plans.
5. **Manage Your Physiology:** Actively work to move your body out of a "fight-or-flight" state through techniques like deep breathing, a short walk, or getting some sleep.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "Are we making this decision from a place of panic or from a place of calm rationality?"
- "What is our pre-agreed plan for a situation like this? Let's consult the checklist."
- "Is this an 'act now' situation, or can we sleep on it?"
- "What's one thing we can do right now to reduce the level of stress in this room?"
- "Are we reacting to the immediate pressure, or are we thinking about the second- and third-order consequences?"
