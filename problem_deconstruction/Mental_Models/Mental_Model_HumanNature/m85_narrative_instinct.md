## Mental Model = Narrative Instinct

**Category = Human Nature & Judgment**
**Description:** 
Often called the "storytelling animal," humans have a deep instinct to make sense of the world by constructing and interpreting narratives. We prefer a compelling story to raw data, and our minds automatically impose a narrative structure—with heroes, villains, causes, and effects—onto random or complex events. This helps us create meaning but can lead to major errors in judgment when the story is more appealing than the truth.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When Investing:** We fall for "story stocks," where a compelling narrative about the future (e.g., "this company will change the world") distracts us from the boring financial realities.
- **In Management and Strategy:** A good story about a project's potential can make us ignore the flaws in the plan. We prefer the narrative of a heroic comeback to the reality of a slow, difficult grind.
- **When Interpreting Randomness:** We see trends and patterns in random data because our mind wants to create a story of cause and effect where none exists (e.g., "the market is up because of X").

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Identify the Narrative:** Recognize the story you are telling yourself or being told. What are the key elements: the hero, the goal, the obstacle?
2. **Deconstruct the Story:** Separate the verifiable facts from the narrative interpretation. What are the raw, unadorned data points?
3. **Consider Alternative Narratives:** Could the same set of facts support a different, less appealing story? What if there is no story, and these are just random events?
4. **Focus on the "Why Not":** The best stories are often about why something will succeed. Force yourself to explore the non-narrative, statistical reasons it might fail (the "base rate").
5. **Trust the Data Over the Story:** When in conflict, a compelling narrative should lose to boring, robust data. Prioritize spreadsheets over stories.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "This is a great story, but what are the actual numbers telling us?"
- "Are we funding a solid plan or just a compelling narrative?"
- "What if there is no 'why' behind this? What if this is just random noise?"
- "Let's take all the emotional, storytelling language out of this pitch. What's left?"
- "Could we construct an equally plausible story where this all ends in disaster? What would that be?"
