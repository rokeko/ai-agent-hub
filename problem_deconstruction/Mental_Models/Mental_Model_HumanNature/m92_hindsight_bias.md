## Mental Model = Hindsight Bias

**Category = Human Nature & Judgment**
**Description:** 
Hindsight Bias is the tendency, after an event has occurred, to see the event as having been predictable, despite there having been little or no objective basis for predicting it. Once we know the outcome, we unconsciously rewrite our own memories and believe we "knew it all along." This prevents us from accurately learning from the past, as we mistake good luck for good judgment and bad luck for stupidity.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When Conducting Performance Reviews or Post-Mortems:** We unfairly judge past decisions based on information that was not available to the decision-maker at the time. "You should have known" is the classic cry of hindsight bias.
- **When Analyzing History or Current Events:** We create neat, linear narratives to explain past events, making them seem inevitable and simple when, in reality, they were complex, chaotic, and uncertain.
- **When Evaluating Your Own Past Decisions:** This bias makes it difficult to learn from your mistakes because you aren't honest with yourself about how uncertain you truly were in the moment.

**Keywords for Situations:** 
Post-mortems, performance reviews, historical analysis, learning from failure, decision-making, "I knew it all along."

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Use a Decision Journal:** Before making a significant decision, write down what you expect to happen and why. This creates a record of your actual thought process, immune to future hindsight bias.
2. **Judge the Process, Not the Outcome:** A good decision can have a bad outcome, and a bad decision can get lucky. Evaluate a choice based on the quality of the reasoning at the time, not on the result.
3. **Conduct "Pre-Mortems," Not Just Post-Mortems:** Before starting a project, imagine it has failed and ask "Why?" This forces you to consider risks before they become "obvious" in hindsight.
4. **Reconstruct the Uncertainty:** When looking back, force yourself to recall all the other plausible outcomes that could have happened but didn't. Actively fight the narrative of inevitability.
5. **Acknowledge the Role of Luck:** Recognize that luck, chance, and randomness play a huge role in most outcomes.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "Let's forget the outcome for a minute. Based on what they knew *at the time*, was this a reasonable decision to make?"
- "What were the other plausible scenarios we were considering that didn't happen?"
- "Are we learning from this failure, or are we just blaming people for not being able to predict the future?"
- "Before we start, let's write down our assumptions. What do we believe will happen, and with what level of confidence?"
- "How much of this successful outcome was due to skill, and how much was just good luck?"
