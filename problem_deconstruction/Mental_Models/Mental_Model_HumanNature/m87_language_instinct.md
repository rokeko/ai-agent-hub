## Mental Model = Language Instinct

**Category = Human Nature & Judgment**
**Description:** 
Pioneered by linguist Noam Chomsky and popularized by psychologist Steven Pinker, the Language Instinct is the idea that the ability to acquire and use complex, grammatical language is a hardwired, biological human trait, not just a cultural invention. Language is the operating system for our thoughts, allowing us to reason, plan, cooperate, and create shared narratives on a scale no other species can match.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When Faced with Jargon and Obfuscation:** Language can be used to intimidate, confuse, and obscure rather than clarify. Be wary of complex language when a simple explanation would suffice; it is often a sign of someone hiding a lack of understanding.
- **When Using Euphemisms:** Pay attention to language that is designed to soften a harsh reality (e.g., "right-sizing" instead of "firing," "collateral damage" instead of "civilian deaths"). Euphemisms can mask the true nature of a decision.
- **When Persuasive Language is at Play:** Be aware of how rhetoric, framing, and emotional language can be used to sway your opinion, independent of the logical merit of the argument.

**Keywords for Situations:** 
Communication, negotiation, politics, marketing, contracts, public speaking, jargon.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Define Your Terms:** The first step in any intelligent discussion is to make sure all parties are using the same words to mean the same things. Force a clear definition of key terms upfront.
2. **Translate Jargon into Simple Language:** If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough. Force yourself or others to translate jargon into plain English.
3. **Question Loaded Language:** Identify words that are designed to evoke an emotional response rather than convey precise meaning.
4. **Distinguish Between the Map and the Territory:** Remember that the words used to describe a situation (the map) are not the situation itself (the territory). Don't get lost in semantic debates.
5. **Listen to What Is *Not* Said:** Sometimes the most important information is what is being omitted or glossed over.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "What do we actually *mean* by that term? Let's define it precisely."
- "Can you explain that to me as if I were a five-year-old?"
- "Is this language designed to clarify the issue or to confuse it?"
- "Let's rephrase this statement without the emotionally charged words. What is it actually saying?"
- "Are we arguing about the reality of the situation, or just about the words we're using to describe it?"
