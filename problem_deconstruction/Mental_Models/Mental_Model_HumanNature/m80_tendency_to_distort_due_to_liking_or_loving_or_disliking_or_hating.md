## Mental Model = Liking/Disliking Tendency

**Category = Human Nature & Judgment**
**Description:** 
This model describes our tendency to distort our thinking in favor of people or things we like and against those we dislike. We are wired to overlook the faults of our friends and the virtues of our enemies. This "halo effect" (or its opposite, the "horns effect") is a mental shortcut that saves energy but often leads to poor judgments, causing us to overrate things we like and underrate things we dislike.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **During Hiring and Performance Reviews:** We naturally overrate the skills of people we find socially charming and underrate those we don't, regardless of their actual competence.
- **When Evaluating Arguments:** We tend to uncritically accept ideas from people and groups we like and automatically reject them from those we dislike, without ever engaging with the substance of the argument itself.
- **In Political and Social Debates:** This tendency is a primary driver of polarization, as it encourages judging ideas based on the "tribe" they come from rather than their merit.

**Keywords for Situations:** 
Hiring, performance reviews, political analysis, team selection, debates, halo effect, tribalism.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Acknowledge Your Feelings:** Be honest with yourself. Do you have a pre-existing positive or negative feeling about the person, group, or idea being discussed?
2. **Separate the Messenger from the Message:** Consciously decouple the source of the idea from the idea itself.
3. **Apply Uniform Standards:** Force yourself to find potential flaws in arguments you like and potential virtues in arguments you dislike. A good practice is "steel-manning" â€” making the strongest possible case for the side you disagree with.
4. **Use a "Reversal Test":** Ask yourself: "If my biggest rival proposed this, would I still support it?" or "If my closest ally did this, would I still condemn it?"
5. **Judge Based on Merits:** Make your final assessment based on the objective facts and logic, not your feelings about the source.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "Let's set aside our feelings about this team for a moment. What are the objective merits of their proposal?"
- "Are we giving this idea a fair hearing, or are we dismissing it because of where it came from?"
- "Would we be this critical of this project if it were proposed by a team we liked more?"
- "Can you make the strongest possible argument *for* the position you dislike? What does that reveal?"
- "Is it possible we are overvaluing their strengths simply because we like them as a person?"
