## Mental Model = Do-Something Tendency

**Category = Human Nature & Judgment**
**Description:** 
This is the bias for action over inaction. In the face of a problem, our instinct is to *do something*, even if that action is counter-productive or unnecessary. This is driven by a need to feel in control and to demonstrate our value. In many complex systems, however, intervention is the cause of problems, not the solution. The wisdom to "just sit there" is rare and valuable.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When Investing:** Most of the time, the correct action in your investment portfolio is to do nothing. The "do-something" tendency leads to excessive trading, high fees, and poor returns.
- **In Management:** A manager who feels the need to constantly intervene, tweak processes, and "add value" can be a major source of disruption and distraction for their team.
- **In Medicine:** This tendency can lead to over-prescription of drugs or over-treatment for conditions that would resolve on their own, often with negative side effects.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Identify the Urge to Act:** Recognize the internal pressure to "just do something" about a situation.
2. **Consider Inaction as a Choice:** Explicitly add "do nothing" to your list of possible options.
3. **Analyze the "Do Nothing" Scenario:** What is the likely outcome if you do not intervene? Is the system self-correcting?
4. **Raise the Bar for Intervention:** Don't just ask "Will this action help?" Ask "Is this action so clearly beneficial that it outweighs all the potential negative second-order effects of my meddling?"
5. **Start with Small, Reversible Actions:** If you must act, try to make your intervention as small and easily reversible as possible.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "What would happen if we just did nothing for a week?"
- "Is our desire to act being driven by a clear need, or just by our own anxiety?"
- "How could our intervention make this situation worse?"
- "What is the absolute smallest action we could take to move forward?"
- "Are we busy, or are we productive? Are all these actions actually helping us achieve our goal?"
