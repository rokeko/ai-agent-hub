## Mental Model = Overgeneralizing from Small Samples

**Category = Human Nature & Judgment**
**Description:** 
This is the tendency to draw broad conclusions from a small amount of data. Our minds are quick to create a general rule from just a few examples, forgetting the statistical rule of the Law of Large Numbers, which states that only a large sample size will reliably reflect the true average. We mistakenly believe in a "Law of Small Numbers," assuming that a small sample is just as representative as a large one.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When Interpreting "The Data":** A study based on a tiny or unrepresentative sample can be worse than no data at all, as it gives the illusion of certainty where none exists.
- **When Acting on Early User Feedback:** The first few customers who provide feedback on a new product are often not representative of the broader market. Overreacting to their specific complaints is a common mistake.
- **When Relying on Personal Experience:** We tend to generalize our own unique experiences to the wider world. ("In my experience, all X are Y.") This is a sample size of one, which is statistically meaningless.

**Keywords for Situations:** 
Statistics, survey data, user feedback, anecdotal evidence, market research, law of large numbers.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Identify the Conclusion:** What general rule or conclusion is being drawn?
2. **Examine the Sample Size:** How many data points is this conclusion based on? Is it 3, 30, or 3,000?
3. **Assess the Sample's Representativeness:** Is this small sample likely to be representative of the entire population? Why or why not? Who is *not* included in this sample?
4. **Seek Larger, More Robust Data:** Instead of relying on the small, available sample, actively look for more comprehensive data, like base rates or larger studies.
5. **Express Uncertainty:** If a decision must be made on a small sample, explicitly state the low level of confidence. Treat the conclusion as a weak hypothesis, not a proven fact.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "What's the sample size for this data? Is it large enough to be meaningful?"
- "We've heard this from two customers. Do we have any reason to believe they represent the other 99.8% of our user base?"
- "Is this conclusion based on a robust data set, or are we just generalizing from a few recent anecdotes?"
- "This survey seems to confirm our belief, but who did they survey? And how many people?"
- "How much money are we willing to bet that this tiny sample accurately reflects the entire market?"
