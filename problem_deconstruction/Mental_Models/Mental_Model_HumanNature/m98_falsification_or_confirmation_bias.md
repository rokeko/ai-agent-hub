## Mental Model = Confirmation Bias & Falsification

**Category = Human Nature & Judgment**
**Description:** 
Confirmation Bias is our powerful tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information that confirms our pre-existing beliefs, while simultaneously ignoring or devaluing information that contradicts them. The rigorous, and unnatural, antidote to this is the principle of Falsification: a belief is only scientific or robust if it can be proven wrong. Instead of asking "How can I prove this is true?", the critical thinker asks "What would prove this is false?"

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When Doing Research:** We tend to use search engines to find evidence that supports our views ("proof that my idea is good") rather than to get an objective view of the topic.
- **In Debates and Discussions:** We listen to the other side not to understand, but to find flaws and formulate our rebuttal. We are seeking to confirm our own rightness, not to find the truth.
- **When Evaluating Yourself:** It is easy to find evidence of your own intelligence and skill. It is much harder, and more valuable, to look for evidence of your own ignorance and mistakes.

**Keywords for Situations:** 
Research, debate, scientific method, intellectual humility, hypothesis testing, "cherry-picking" data.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **State Your Belief as a Falsifiable Hypothesis:** Take your belief and state it in a way that could be proven wrong. Instead of "This project will be a success," try "If we don't hit X metric by Y date, we will know this project is not working."
2. **Actively Seek Disconfirming Evidence:** Don't just look for proof you are right; actively search for evidence that you are wrong. Spend more time trying to "kill" your idea than to confirm it. This is sometimes called a "red team" exercise.
3. **"Steel-Man" the Other Side:** Instead of making a weak "straw-man" caricature of the opposing view, make the strongest possible argument for it. Argue it even better than its proponents do.
4. **Consider the Opposite:** Before making a decision, take a moment to pause and genuinely ask yourself, "What if the opposite of my belief were true?"
5. **Keep a "Mistake Journal":** Keep a log of when you were wrong. This trains your brain to see being wrong as an opportunity for learning, not a threat to your ego.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "We all seem to agree this is a good idea. What's the best argument *against* it?"
- "What evidence would we need to see to change our minds on this?"
- "If we are wrong, how will we know?"
- "Let's assume we're suffering from confirmation bias. Where would we be most likely to find evidence that contradicts our current view?"
- "Instead of asking 'Is this true?', let's ask 'Under what conditions would this not be true?'"
