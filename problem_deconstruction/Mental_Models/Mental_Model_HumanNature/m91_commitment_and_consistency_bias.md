## Mental Model = Commitment & Consistency Bias

**Category = Human Nature & Judgment**
**Description:** 
This bias is our deep-seated need to be, and to appear, consistent with what we have already done or said. Once we make a choice or take a stand, we face personal and interpersonal pressure to behave consistently with that commitment. This allows for social trust and cohesion, but it can also lead us to stick with bad decisions long after they should have been abandoned, simply to avoid the psychological discomfort of inconsistency.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **In Long-Term Projects ("Sunk Costs"):** We continue to pour time, money, and energy into failing projects because we are already committed, instead of cutting our losses. The previous investment feels like a commitment that must be honored.
- **After Making a Public Statement:** Once we declare something publicly, our desire to remain consistent makes it very difficult to change our minds, even in the face of overwhelming new evidence.
- **When a Belief Becomes Part of Your Identity:** When a belief becomes "who I am" (e.g., "I am a value investor"), it becomes nearly impossible to evaluate contradictory evidence fairly. To question the belief is to question your identity.

**Keywords for Situations:** 
Sunk cost fallacy, cognitive dissonance, identity, public statements, long-term projects, brand loyalty.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Identify the Prior Commitment:** What past decision, statement, or belief is influencing your current choice?
2. **Separate the Past from the Future:** Acknowledge any sunk costs (time, money, effort) as gone forever. They cannot be recovered.
3. **Evaluate the Decision on Today's Merits:** Ask the key question: "Knowing what I know now, if I were starting from scratch today, would I still make this same choice?"
4. **Give Yourself Permission to Be Inconsistent:** Frame changing your mind as a sign of strength and learning, not weakness. As John Maynard Keynes supposedly said, "When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?"
5. **Decide Based on Future Outcomes:** Make your decision based purely on where you want to go from here, not on where you have been.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "Are we continuing this project because it's still a good idea, or because we've already invested so much in it?"
- "Let's ignore all our past decisions for a moment. Knowing what we know right now, what is the best path forward?"
- "Is it possible that we are sticking with this plan just to avoid admitting we were wrong?"
- "What would it take for us to change our minds on this? What evidence would we need to see?"
- "Is this belief serving us, or are we serving it?"
