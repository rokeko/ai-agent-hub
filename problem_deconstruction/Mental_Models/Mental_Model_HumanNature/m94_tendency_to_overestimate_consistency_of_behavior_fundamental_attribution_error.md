## Mental Model = Fundamental Attribution Error

**Category = Human Nature & Judgment**
**Description:** 
This is our tendency to explain someone's behavior by their internal character ("that's who they are") while underestimating the power of their situation and context. We attribute our own failures to the situation ("I was having a bad day"), but we attribute others' failures to their personality ("they are incompetent"). This leads us to make harsh judgments about others and to be blind to the situational factors influencing our own behavior.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When Judging a Colleague's Performance:** Before concluding someone is lazy or incompetent, consider the situational factors that might be affecting them: a difficult project, a family crisis, or unclear instructions.
- **When Evaluating a Leader or Public Figure:** We tend to see their actions as a direct reflection of their character, ignoring the immense situational pressures, constraints, and incentives they are operating under.
- **When Explaining Your Own Success:** We tend to attribute our successes to our own brilliance and character, while conveniently ignoring the role of luck, privilege, and situational advantages.

**Keywords for Situations:** 
Performance reviews, character judgments, leadership analysis, understanding behavior, "actor-observer" bias.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Identify the Attribution:** How are you explaining a specific behavior? Are you attributing it to the person's character or to their situation?
2. **"Look Out the Window":** Force yourself to consider the external, situational factors first. What pressures, constraints, or incentives might be shaping this person's actions?
3. **"Look in the Mirror":** When explaining your own behavior, reverse the process. Start by questioning your own character traits or biases before jumping to situational excuses.
4. **Use the "Reversal Test":** If you saw someone else behaving in the exact same way you are, how would you judge them? If you were in their exact situation, how might you behave?
5. **Assume Good Intentions (Hanlon's Razor):** Before attributing a negative outcome to someone's bad character, first consider if it could be explained by situational factors you don't fully understand.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "Are we judging their character, or are we analyzing the situation they were in?"
- "Let's assume this person is smart and rational. What in their environment could have led them to behave this way?"
- "If we put a different person in that exact same situation, would we expect a different outcome?"
- "Before we blame the individual, have we done everything we can to create a situation where they can succeed?"
- "How much of our own success in this area is due to our inherent talent versus the advantages of our situation?"
