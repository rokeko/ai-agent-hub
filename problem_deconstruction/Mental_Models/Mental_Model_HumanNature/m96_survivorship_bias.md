## Mental Model = Survivorship Bias

**Category = Human Nature & Judgment**
**Description:** 
Survivorship Bias is the logical error of concentrating on the people or things that "survived" some process and inadvertently overlooking those that did not because of their lack of visibility. We see the successful entrepreneurs, the winning strategies, and the ancient buildings that are still standing, and we learn from them. But we don't see the thousands of failed entrepreneurs, the identical strategies that failed due to bad luck, or the buildings that collapsed. This leads to an overly optimistic and often misleading understanding of reality.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When Learning from Business "Best Practices":** We study the habits of successful companies like Google and Amazon, but we don't study the thousands of failed companies that probably had the exact same habits. The success might be due to luck, not the habits.
- **When Taking Career Advice from Famous People:** We listen to advice from college dropouts who became billionaires, forgetting the silent graveyard of thousands of other dropouts who were not so successful.
- **When Assessing the "Quality" of Old Things:** We assume old cars or buildings were better made than new ones because the few that still exist are in good shape, forgetting that the vast majority of poorly made old things have long since turned to dust.

**Keywords for Situations:** 
Business strategy, historical analysis, selection bias, statistics, "silent evidence," case studies.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Identify the "Survivors":** Who or what is being held up as a model of success?
2. **Seek Out the "Silent Graveyard":** For every winner, there is a "cemetery" of losers who are not visible. Actively ask: "What am I not seeing?" "Who tried this and failed?"
3. **Question the Narrative of Success:** Instead of assuming the survivor's traits caused the success, consider the role of luck, randomness, and hidden advantages.
4. **Study Failures as Diligently as Successes:** A post-mortem of a failed project often provides more valuable lessons than a case study of a successful one.
5. **Avoid Drawing Simple Causal Links:** Be skeptical of any advice that says, "Do X, Y, and Z to be successful like me." The most important factors for success are often invisible to the survivors themselves.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "We're studying the habits of successful companies, but how many *unsuccessful* companies had the exact same habits?"
- "What are we not seeing? Who are the people who followed this same advice and failed?"
- "Is this company's success due to skill, or were they just lucky to be in the right market at the right time?"
- "Instead of another case study on a success, let's do a post-mortem on a recent failure. What can we learn from that?"
- "We admire the beautiful old buildings that are still standing, but what about the thousands that fell down? What can they teach us?"
