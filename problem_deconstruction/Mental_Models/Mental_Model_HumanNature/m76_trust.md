## Mental Model = Trust

**Category = Human Nature & Judgment**
**Description:** 
Trust is the confident reliance on the integrity, strength, ability, or character of a person or thing. It's the bedrock of all social and economic interactions, enabling cooperation, reducing complexity, and making systems more efficient. The modern world, from family units to global markets, is built on a complex web of trust.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **In High-Stakes, Low-Information Scenarios:** Avoid granting immediate, high levels of trust when you have little information about the other party and the consequences of failure are severe.
- **When Incentives are Misaligned:** Be cautious when the other party's incentives directly conflict with your own. Their need to win may outweigh their commitment to being trustworthy.
- **Without a System for Verification:** "Trust, but verify" is a crucial addendum. Blind trust without any mechanism for accountability is often misplaced and can be exploited.

**Keywords for Situations:** 
Delegation, teamwork, negotiation, relationships, investment, contracts, leadership.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Assess the Stakes:** What is the potential upside of trusting and the potential downside of being wrong?
2. **Evaluate Incentives and Reputation:** What is the other party's track record? What do they gain by being trustworthy and what do they lose by breaking that trust?
3. **Start Small:** Grant trust in small, incremental steps. Use small "tests" to gauge reliability before committing to larger-scale trust.
4. **Establish Clear Expectations:** Define the terms of the relationship or agreement explicitly. Ambiguity is the enemy of trust.
5. **Continuously Verify and Adjust:** Don't treat trust as a one-time decision. Pay attention to actions, not just words, and be prepared to adjust your level of trust based on new evidence.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "What is the evidence for and against trusting this person or system?"
- "What are their incentives to be trustworthy in this specific situation?"
- "What is the smallest, safest way we can test for trustworthiness here?"
- "Are we confusing a feeling of familiarity with genuine, earned trust?"
- "What would need to happen for us to lose trust? What is our 'tripwire'?"
