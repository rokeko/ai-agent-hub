## Mental Model = First-Conclusion Bias

**Category = Human Nature & Judgment**
**Description:** 
This bias describes our tendency to settle on the first conclusion that comes to mind and then, as Charlie Munger puts it, our mind "shuts." We grab the first plausible explanation and then stop thinking, becoming resistant to alternative ideas. This is an energy-saving mental shortcut, but it's a major barrier to critical thinking and often leads to simplistic and wrong answers.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **During Brainstorming and Strategy:** The first idea presented is often the most conventional one. Locking onto it prematurely kills innovation and prevents the exploration of better, non-obvious solutions.
- **In Debugging and Problem-Solving:** When troubleshooting, the first apparent cause of a problem is often just a symptom. This bias leads us to fix the symptom while ignoring the deeper root cause.
- **In Medical or Scientific Diagnosis:** A doctor or scientist who latches onto the first plausible diagnosis may fail to consider other possibilities, leading them to miss the correct explanation.

**Keywords for Situations:** 
Brainstorming, debugging, diagnosis, investigation, decision-making, anchoring.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Don't Decide Immediately:** When faced with a problem, consciously pause. Don't let yourself lock onto the first explanation that pops into your head.
2. **Generate Multiple Competing Hypotheses:** Force yourself to come up with at least three to five plausible explanations for the same set of facts. This breaks the "first-conclusion" lock.
3. **Seek Disconfirming Evidence:** For your favorite or first hypothesis, actively try to disprove it. What evidence would show that it's wrong? (This is related to Falsification).
4. **Gather More Information:** Don't just analyze the information you have; ask what information is missing that could help you differentiate between your hypotheses.
5. **Decide Based on a Comparative Evaluation:** Choose the best explanation from your list of alternatives, not just the first one that came to mind.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "That's one plausible explanation. What are two other possibilities?"
- "Let's assume our initial conclusion is wrong. What else could be causing this?"
- "What's the single best piece of evidence that could convince us we're mistaken?"
- "We've all seemed to agree on this pretty quickly. What might we be missing?"
- "Before we commit to this path, let's spend 10 minutes trying to come up with a better one."
