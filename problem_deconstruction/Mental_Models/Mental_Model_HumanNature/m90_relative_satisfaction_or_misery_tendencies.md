## Mental Model = Relative Satisfaction

**Category = Human Nature & Judgment**
**Description:** 
Our brains do not judge our well-being in absolute terms, but in relative terms. Our sense of happiness or misery is determined not by our objective circumstances, but by how those circumstances compare to our expectations, our past, or the situation of our peers. This is why a pay raise can feel good for a week, and then feel normal, or why seeing a neighbor's new car can diminish the joy we get from our own.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When Making Career and Life Choices:** Chasing a goal simply to "keep up with the Joneses" is a recipe for misery, as the finish line is always moving. You are outsourcing your happiness to the choices of others.
- **When Setting Goals:** Be careful about setting expectations. If happiness is the gap between reality and expectations, then unrealistically high expectations can guarantee misery, even with great objective success.
- **When Using Social Media:** Social media is an engine for relative misery, constantly presenting you with a curated, superior version of everyone else's life, which distorts your own sense of well-being.

**Keywords for Situations:** 
Happiness, goal setting, social comparison, lifestyle inflation, hedonic treadmill, keeping up with the Joneses.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Recognize the Comparison:** When you feel a pang of dissatisfaction or envy, identify the comparison you are making. Are you comparing yourself to your past self, a peer, or an idealized expectation?
2. **Shift to an Absolute Metric:** Instead of relative comparison, try to use an absolute benchmark. "Do I have enough to be healthy and safe?" "Is my progress aligned with my own values?"
3. **Practice Gratitude:** Actively focus on what you have in absolute terms, not on what you lack in relative terms. This is a direct counter-measure to the relative satisfaction tendency.
4. **Manage Your Inputs:** Be conscious of the information you consume. Curate your social media feeds and information diet to reduce exposure to unhealthy comparisons.
5. **Compare Yourself to Your Past Self:** If you must compare, the most productive comparison is to your past self. Are you making progress on your own terms?

**Coaching Questions:**
- "Is this goal based on our own intrinsic values, or are we just trying to keep up with a competitor?"
- "If we achieve this, will we be satisfied, or will we just create a new, higher benchmark for our dissatisfaction?"
- "Are we judging our success on our own terms, or on terms set by others?"
- "Let's ignore what our peers are doing for a moment. What is the right decision for us, in absolute terms?"
- "What if we defined 'enough' as an absolute number, instead of just 'more than them'?"
