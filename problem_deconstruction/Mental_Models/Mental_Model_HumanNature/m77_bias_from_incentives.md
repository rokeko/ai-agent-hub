## Mental Model = Bias from Incentives

**Category = Human Nature & Judgment**
**Description:** 
This model describes the pervasive human tendency to distort our thinking, perception, and conclusions in the direction of our own self-interest. When we have a stake in the outcome, our minds unconsciously find ways to believe whatever is most convenient or profitable for us. As Upton Sinclair said, "It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it."

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When Taking Advice:** Be extremely skeptical of advice from people who stand to gain financially from your decision (e.g., a financial advisor selling a specific product, a real estate agent).
- **In Your Own High-Stakes Decisions:** Actively fight this bias in yourself. When you want something to be true, your brain will work overtime to convince you it is.
- **When Judging Others:** Before attributing someone's actions to malice or stupidity, first consider what incentives might be driving their behavior.

**Keywords for Situations:** 
Sales pitches, negotiations, financial advice, corporate governance, performance reviews, punditry, agency problems.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Identify the Key Players:** Who are the decision-makers and influencers in this situation?
2. **Follow the Incentives:** For each player, determine how they are compensated or what they stand to gain/lose. Look beyond stated intentions to the underlying incentive structure.
3. **Question the Narrative:** How might the incentives be shaping the arguments, data, and conclusions being presented?
4. **Invert the Problem:** Ask, "What narrative or conclusion would serve their incentives perfectly?" and see how closely it matches what they are saying.
5. **Seek Disinterested Opinions:** Find a knowledgeable, independent third party with no stake in the outcome and get their perspective.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "Who benefits financially if we choose this option?"
- "How is this person/team compensated, and how might that be influencing their recommendation?"
- "What would the argument be from someone who had the opposite set of incentives?"
- "Are we making this decision based on objective facts, or is our desire for a certain outcome clouding our judgment?"
- "Let's ignore their words for a moment and just look at their incentives. What do the incentives predict they would do or say?"
