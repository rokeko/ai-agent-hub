## Mental Model = Availability Heuristic

**Category = Human Nature & Judgment**
**Description:** 
The Availability Heuristic is a mental shortcut where we judge the likelihood and importance of an event based on how easily examples come to mind. If something is recent, vivid, or emotionally charged, our brain assumes it is more common or important than it actually is. This leads to skewed perceptions of risk, frequency, and reality.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When Assessing Risk:** After a major news event (like a plane crash or shark attack), we overestimate the probability of that event happening to us because the memory is so vivid and available, even if the statistical reality is unchanged.
- **In Strategic Planning:** Teams often overemphasize recent successes or failures when forecasting future performance, assuming the recent past is more representative of the future than it really is.
- **When Using Anecdotal Evidence:** A single, powerful story ("My uncle smoked his whole life and lived to 95") is more available and often feels more persuasive than robust statistical data, leading to poor decisions.

**Keywords for Situations:** 
Risk assessment, strategic planning, news consumption, medical diagnoses, financial investment, anecdotal evidence.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Identify the Judgment:** What assessment of risk, frequency, or probability are you making?
2. **Analyze What Comes to Mind:** What specific examples or stories are informing this judgment?
3. **Question Their Availability:** Is this information top-of-mind because it's statistically common, or simply because it was recent, vivid, shocking, or repeated often?
4. **Seek Out the Base Rates:** Actively look for the actual statistics and long-term data. Go beyond the memorable anecdotes and find the boring, aggregate numbers.
5. **Adjust Your Judgment:** Deliberately give more weight to the boring statistical data and less to the exciting, available stories. Correct your gut feeling with the evidence.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "Are we making this decision based on this one recent, vivid example, or on the long-term data?"
- "We all remember that one catastrophic failure, but what do the statistics say is the *actual* failure rate?"
- "Is this a real trend, or are we just noticing it more because it's been in the headlines lately?"
- "We're relying on a single anecdote to guide our policy. Where can we find the base rate for this kind of event?"
- "Forget what comes to mind easily for a moment. What do the hard, boring numbers tell us?"
