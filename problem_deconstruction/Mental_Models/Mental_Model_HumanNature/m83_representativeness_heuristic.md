## Mental Model = Representativeness Heuristic

**Category = Human Nature & Judgment**
**Description:** 
The Representativeness Heuristic is a mental shortcut where we classify something based on how similar it is to a typical case or stereotype we hold in our mind. We judge by resemblance, asking "how much does this look like X?" instead of asking "what is the statistical probability of X?" This leads us to ignore base rates, fall for detailed but improbable stories (the conjunction fallacy), and rely too heavily on stereotypes.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When Making Judgments About People:** We might assume a quiet, studious person is a librarian because they fit the stereotype, ignoring the fact that there are vastly more salespeople (the base rate).
- **In Financial Analysis:** A company might seem "representative" of the next big thing (e.g., charismatic founder, disruptive story), causing us to ignore the massive base rate of startup failures.
- **In Medical Diagnosis:** A set of symptoms might seem to perfectly represent a rare, "textbook" disease, causing a doctor to overlook a much more common illness that is statistically more likely.

**Keywords for Situations:** 
Stereotyping, first impressions, financial forecasting, hiring, medical diagnosis, conspiracy theories, base rate neglect.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Identify Your Judgment:** What category are you placing this person or event into?
2. **Identify the Stereotype:** What "typical case" or mental model is this judgment based on? (e.g., "This looks just like a classic startup success story.")
3. **Find the Base Rate:** Actively ignore the compelling narrative and find the statistical reality. How many startups actually succeed? What is the actual prevalence of this disease?
4. **Beware the Conjunction Fallacy:** A more detailed and specific story always feels more plausible, but is always less probable. Remember that P(A and B) can never be greater than P(A).
5. **Correct Your Judgment:** Base your final assessment on the statistical reality (the base rate), not on how well the situation "represents" a familiar story.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "This person seems to fit our stereotype of a 'maverick genius,' but what is the actual base rate of success for people with that profile?"
- "Are we falling in love with a good story, or are we looking at the statistical odds?"
- "This explanation is very detailed and specific, which makes it compelling. But is it more *probable* than a simpler, more boring explanation?"
- "We are treating this like a textbook case, but what do the numbers say is the most common cause of this particular issue?"
- "Let's ignore the narrative for a second. What are the raw probabilities we're dealing with?"
