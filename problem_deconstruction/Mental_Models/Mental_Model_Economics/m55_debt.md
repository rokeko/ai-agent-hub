## Mental Model = Debt

**Category = Economics**
**Description:** 
Debt is the act of borrowing from the future to serve the present. It is a powerful form of leverage that allows individuals and businesses to acquire assets, fund growth, or seize opportunities they couldn't otherwise afford. However, this power comes at a cost: debt creates a future obligation that reduces future flexibility and introduces significant risk. The concept extends beyond money to social obligations, favors, or even sleep.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When It Creates Fragility:** As the text warns, debt is like "driving across a vast desert without a spare tire." It removes your margin of safety and makes you highly vulnerable to unexpected life events like a job loss, health crisis, or economic downturn. The more you borrow, the less room you have to weather life's storms.
- **For Depreciating or Consumable Assets:** Using debt to fund a lifestyle or purchase things that lose value (e.g., fancy cars, vacations) is a recipe for financial trouble. It's far wiser to use debt for assets that can appreciate or generate income (e.g., a sensible home, education, or a business).
- **Without a Clear Repayment Plan:** Taking on debt without a clear and realistic strategy to pay it off is hoping for the best. Hope is not a strategy.
- **When It Restricts Your Freedom:** High debt payments can lock you into a specific job or career path, preventing you from taking risks, pursuing opportunities, or making changes in your life. It can chain you to a present you no longer want.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Define the Purpose:** Is this "good debt" (investing in an asset that should grow in value) or "bad debt" (funding consumption)?
2. **Calculate the True Cost:** What is the interest rate, what are the fees, and what is the total amount you will have paid by the end of the term? Acknowledge that the future cost is often higher than it feels in the moment.
3. **Assess the Added Fragility:** What is your plan to make payments if your income suddenly decreases? What is your margin of safety?
4. **Quantify the Lost Optionality:** What opportunities might you have to say "no" to in the future because of this obligation?
5. **Establish a Clear Exit Strategy:** How, specifically, will you eliminate this debt, and by when?

**Coaching Questions:**
- "What is the absolute worst-case scenario if we take on this leverage, and are we prepared for it?"
- "Is this debt creating value and opportunity, or is it simply funding a lifestyle we can't sustain?"
- "By saying 'yes' to this loan, what future freedoms are we saying 'no' to?"
- "Have we stress-tested our ability to repay this if our circumstances change?"
- "What's our plan to get to zero debt?"
