## Mental Model = Gresham's Law

**Category = Economics**
**Description:** 
Gresham's Law states that "bad money drives out good." In a system where two forms of currency are accepted as legal tender with the same face value, the one with lower intrinsic value (bad money) will be used in circulation, while the one with higher intrinsic value (good money) will be hoarded and disappear. This principle extends beyond currency to any situation where a low-quality version of something can be passed off at the same "price" as a high-quality version, leading to a decline in overall quality.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **In Free-Floating Markets:** The law is most powerful when an artificial exchange rate is fixed by an authority. In a truly free market where prices can adjust, the "good" item can often command a higher price and drive out the "bad" item over time.
- **As a Justification for Cynicism:** While the law describes a powerful negative tendency, it is not an immutable law of nature. As the text notes, "overcoming this requires constant effort." It should be seen as a force to be counteracted, not an excuse for accepting low standards.
- **Without Considering the Time Horizon:** The law describes a short-term dynamic. A company that ships shoddy products (bad money) may win in the short term, but over the long run, a company with a reputation for quality (good money) often wins as the market recognizes the true value.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Identify the Competing "Currencies":** Find a system where a "good" (high-quality, honest) version and a "bad" (low-quality, corrupt) version of something are treated as having the same face value. Examples: lazy vs. diligent employees, well-researched news vs. clickbait.
2. **Analyze the Incentives to Hoard:** Why would someone want to hold on to the "good" version and spend the "bad" version? (e.g., hoarding your best employees for your own team, passing off difficult tasks).
3. **Observe What is Circulating:** Is the "bad" version becoming more prevalent in everyday interactions? Is good work being hidden or driven out? Is bad behavior becoming normalized?
4. **Introduce a "Value Detector":** What mechanism can you introduce to expose the true cost of the bad and the true value of the good? This could be through performance metrics, quality control, transparent reviews, or a strong culture of accountability.
5. **Protect the Good:** Create systems that explicitly reward and protect the high-quality contributions and behaviors you want to encourage, ensuring they are not driven out by their low-quality counterparts.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "In our culture, is 'bad behavior' driving out 'good behavior'?"
- "Are we allowing superficial, low-quality work to be accepted as readily as deep, high-quality work?"
- "What are the 'cheap coins' in our organization (e.g., blame, shortcuts, gossip) and how can we take them out of circulation?"
- "How do we ensure our 'good money'—our best people, ideas, and ethical standards—are the ones that define our culture?"
- "Is this decision optimizing for a short-term win at the expense of our long-term reputation for quality?"
