## Mental Model = Trade-offs & Opportunity Cost

**Category = Economics**
**Description:** 
Every decision is a trade-off. By choosing one path, you implicitly say no to all others. The value of the path not taken is the **opportunity cost**â€”the next-best alternative you gave up. A **trade-off** is the process of weighing these options and their respective opportunity costs. You can't have it all, so this model is about making conscious choices to gain what matters most by giving up something of lesser value.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When Facing False Dichotomies:** Don't get trapped into thinking you only have two unpleasant options (A or B). Often, a creative third path (C) exists that can mitigate the trade-off. Step back and ask if the choice is as binary as it seems.
- **For Low-Stakes Decisions:** Over-analyzing the opportunity cost of a minor, easily reversible decision (e.g., what to eat for lunch) leads to analysis paralysis and wastes mental energy.
- **When Ignoring Non-Financial Costs:** Opportunity costs are not just monetary. The cost of taking a high-paying job with long hours might be time with family, health, or personal growth. Ensure you are weighing all relevant factors, not just the easily quantifiable ones.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Identify the Core Decision:** What is the specific choice you need to make?
2. **List All Viable Options:** What are the different paths you could realistically take?
3. **For Each Option, Define the Gains:** What are the clear benefits you receive by choosing it?
4. **Identify the Opportunity Cost:** For each option, what is the most significant benefit from the *other* options that you would be giving up? This is the true cost of your choice.
5. **Align with Priorities:** Compare the gains and opportunity costs of each option against your most important long-term goals and values.
6. **Make a Deliberate Choice:** Consciously accept the trade-off and the associated opportunity cost, knowing you've made an intentional decision based on what matters most.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "If we choose to do this, what are we choosing *not* to do as a result?"
- "What is the opportunity cost of assigning our best people to this project?"
- "We're discussing options A and B, but is there a creative option C we haven't considered?"
- "We see the immediate benefit, but what are the long-term consequences and trade-offs?"
- "Which decision aligns best with our core strategy, even if it means sacrificing a short-term gain?"
