## Mental Model = Supply and Demand

**Category = Economics**
**Description:** 
Supply and demand is the core mechanism of a market economy, representing the dynamic relationship between the availability of a product or service (supply) and the desire for it (demand). This constant push and pull determines everything from price to resource allocation. High demand and low supply cause prices to rise, while low demand and high supply cause them to fall. This model explains not just market prices, but who gets what and how investment flows toward areas of unmet need.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **In Inelastic Markets:** The model is less predictive for goods where demand does not change with price (e.g., life-saving medicine). In these cases, other factors beyond simple supply are at play.
- **When Influenced by Extreme Emotion:** As the text notes, human nature can hijack the mechanism. Market cycles driven by greed can create speculative bubbles where price detaches from real value, while cycles driven by fear can cause crashes and irrational belt-tightening.
- **For Non-Market Goods:** Applying supply and demand logic to things like friendship, love, or artistic passion can be misleading. Their value isn't determined by market transactions, and trying to force them into this model can distort their nature.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Define the Market:** Clearly identify the product, service, or skill you are analyzing.
2. **Assess the Supply:** How much of it is available? Is it easy or difficult to create more? Who are the key suppliers?
3. **Assess the Demand:** Who wants it? How badly do they want it? Are there alternatives or substitutes?
4. **Find the Equilibrium:** Observe how supply and demand are interacting to set the current price or value. Where is the balance point?
5. **Consider the Human Factor:** Are emotional drivers like hype, greed, or fear exaggerating the market dynamics? Is there a speculative bubble or an irrational panic?
6. **Determine Your Role:** As a consumer, producer, or negotiator, recognize that your choices are an active part of this system. Decide how you can act wisely based on the current conditions.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "What are the primary factors currently driving supply for this?"
- "What are the primary factors currently driving demand for this?"
- "Is the current price a fair reflection of its underlying value, or is it being inflated by hype?"
- "If we entered this market, how would our presence affect the supply and demand balance?"
- "Are we making this decision based on the rational forces of supply and demand, or are we being influenced by market sentiment?"
