## Mental Model = Bubbles

**Category = Economics**
**Description:** 
A speculative bubble occurs when the price of an asset (like a stock, house, or cryptocurrency) rises to a level that is far beyond its fundamental, intrinsic value. This state is not driven by sober calculation but by collective enthusiasm, greed, and a powerful "fear of missing out" (FOMO). Fueled by a narrative that "this time is different," bubbles are a study in mass psychology, where price is dictated by emotion, not value. While they always pop, they can accelerate innovation by funding the infrastructure for future technological revolutions.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When You Think You Can Time the Pop:** The most dangerous assumption during a bubble is that you are smart enough to ride the wave up and get out just before it crashes. The end comes abruptly and without warning, leaving most speculators in financial ruin.
- **When "New Metrics" Are Invented to Justify Price:** When traditional valuation methods (like price-to-earnings ratios) are dismissed in favor of new, exotic metrics (like "price per eyeball"), it's a massive red flag that the narrative is trying to justify an irrational price.
- **When You Mistake Price for a Signal of Value:** In a bubble, the rising price is the *only* thing that seems to justify the investment. People buy because the price is going up, which makes the price go up further, creating a feedback loop un-tethered from reality.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Analyze Price vs. Intrinsic Value:** Is the asset's price growing exponentially and becoming detached from its underlying fundamentals (e.g., earnings, cash flow, utility)?
2. **Identify the Seductive Narrative:** What is the compelling story everyone is telling about why "this time is different" and the old rules of valuation no longer apply?
3. **Spot the Social Proof and FOMO:** Are people buying because their friends are getting rich? Is there a palpable sense of urgency to get in before it's too late? Is the media full of stories of amateur investors striking it rich?
4. **Look for an Influx of "Dumb Money":** Are novice investors with little understanding of the asset rushing into the market? This is often a sign that the bubble is in its final, most dangerous stages.
5. **Ground Yourself in Fundamental Value:** As the text advises, intentionally step back from the hype. Ignore the price action and ask: What is the real, tangible value here? What is the worst-case scenario? What would I be willing to pay for this if I couldn't sell it for 10 years?

**Coaching Questions:**
- "Are we investing in this because we understand its fundamental value, or because we hope the price will keep going up?"
- "What is the story we're telling ourselves to justify this valuation? How could that story be wrong?"
- "If the price of this asset fell by 70% and stayed there, how would it affect our financial health and would we still be glad we bought it?"
- "Who is on the other side of this trade, and what might they know that we don't?"
- "Let's forget the hype. What is the simple, boring, economic reality of this situation?"
