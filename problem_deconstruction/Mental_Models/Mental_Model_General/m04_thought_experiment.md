## Mental Model = Thought Experiment

**Category = General Thinking Tools**
**Description:** 
A thought experiment is a mental simulation used to explore the potential consequences of an idea or action without having to enact it in reality. It's a way of thinking through possibilities, testing hypotheses, and uncovering implications in the "laboratory of the mind."

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When Direct Experimentation is Cheap:** If you can easily test a hypothesis in the real world, do that instead. A thought experiment is a substitute for, not a superior alternative to, real-world data.
- **If You Lack Foundational Knowledge:** A thought experiment is only as good as the user's understanding of the variables. If the user is ignorant of the basic principles of a system, the simulation will be flawed and its conclusions unreliable.

**Keywords for Situations:** 
Major life decisions, strategic planning, ethical dilemmas, scientific theorizing, creative problem-solving.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Define the Scenario:** Clearly state the hypothesis or decision you want to explore.
2. **Establish the Conditions:** Set the initial parameters and constraints of the experiment. What are the rules?
3. **Run the Simulation:** Mentally play out the scenario. Imagine the sequence of events that would follow.
4. **Explore Consequences:** Consider the immediate outcomes, the secondary effects (second-order thinking), and potential unintended consequences. Think about the best-case, worst-case, and most likely scenarios.
5. **Draw Conclusions:** What did you learn from the simulation? What insights did it provide that can inform your real-world decision?

**Coaching Questions:**
- "Let's imagine we go ahead with this plan. Walk me through what happens next, step by step."
- "What is the absolute worst-case scenario that could result from this decision? Let's play that out in our minds."
- "If we had a magic wand and could see the outcome one year from now, what might we see?"
- "What factors have we not considered in this mental simulation?"
- "How would this decision affect our finances, stress levels, and relationships over the next six months?"
