## Mental Model = Occam's Razor

**Category = General Thinking Tools**
**Description:**
Occam's Razor is a problem-solving principle that states when you are presented with multiple competing explanations for a phenomenon, the simplest one—the one with the fewest assumptions—is the most likely to be correct. It's a mental razor that "shaves away" unnecessary complexity.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **Inherently Complex Systems:** Do not apply rigidly to fields like biology, economics, or social dynamics, where outcomes often result from many interacting variables and the simplest explanation can be misleading.
- **When Evidence Points to Complexity:** If the simplest explanation is tested and fails to account for the evidence, it must be discarded in favor of a more complex one that fits the facts.
- **Insufficient Data:** Be cautious when evidence is scarce. The "simplest" explanation may just be the most obvious, not the most correct.

**Keywords for Situations:** 
Troubleshooting, scientific theorizing, medical diagnosis, debugging code, investigations.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Gather All Plausible Explanations:** List all the different hypotheses or theories that could explain the phenomenon you're observing.	
2. **Count the Assumptions:** For each explanation, identify and count the number of new assumptions or complex entities it requires.
3. **Identify the Simplest Explanation:** The explanation that relies on the fewest new, unproven assumptions is the one to favor.
4. **Test the Simplest Explanation First:** Before diving into complex theories, start by investigating the most straightforward possibility.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "What is the absolute simplest possible explanation for this?"
- "Which of these theories requires us to believe the fewest new things?"
- "Are we making this more complicated than it needs to be?"
- "Before we assume a complex conspiracy, have we ruled out a simple mistake?"
- "What is the most direct cause-and-effect relationship we can see here?"
