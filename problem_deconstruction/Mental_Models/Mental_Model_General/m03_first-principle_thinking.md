## Mental Model = First-Principle Thinking

**Category = General Thinking Tools**
**Description:** 
First-principles thinking is the act of deconstructing a problem or idea down to its most fundamental, foundational truthsâ€”the things you know are true beyond any doubt. From there, you reason up from scratch, challenging all assumptions and conventions. It's the opposite of reasoning by analogy (i.e., "we do it this way because that's how it's always been done").

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **For Incremental Improvements:** When a system is already working well and only needs minor optimization, reasoning from first principles is often too slow and unnecessary. Analogy and precedent are more efficient here.
- **Under Severe Time Constraints:** Deconstructing a problem to its core takes time. When a rapid decision is required, relying on established best practices is often the only viable option.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Identify the Problem/Goal:** Clearly state the problem you are trying to solve or the goal you are trying to achieve.
2. **Deconstruct the Problem:** Break the problem down into its most basic components or truths. Ask "Why?" repeatedly, like a child, until you can't go any deeper. What are the absolute, fundamental building blocks?
3. **Challenge Every Assumption:** Question the conventional wisdom and assumptions surrounding each component. Ask, "How do I know this is true?" and "Is this necessarily the only way?"
4. **Reconstruct from the Ground Up:** Using the verified fundamental truths, start to build a new solution or approach from scratch, ignoring previous methods.
5. **Optimize the New Solution:** Refine your new approach based on logic and evidence, not on tradition.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "What are the fundamental truths or facts of this situation?"
- "Why do we believe this has to be done this way?"
- "What if we were starting from a blank slate with no pre-existing knowledge of this industry?"
- "What are the raw materials of this problem, both literally and figuratively?"
- "Let's pretend we're explaining this to a five-year-old. What are the simplest truths we can state?"
