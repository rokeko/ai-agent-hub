## Mental Model = Second-Order Thinking

**Category = General Thinking Tools**
**Description:** 
This is the practice of thinking beyond the immediate consequences of a decision and considering the longer-term, "and then what?" effects. First-order thinking is fast and easy, focusing on the direct result. Second-order thinking is more deliberate and complex, as it explores the ripple effects and unintended consequences that unfold over time.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **In True Emergencies:** During a crisis that requires an immediate response (e.g., a server is down), the priority is the first-order effect of fixing the problem. Second-order analysis can wait until after the immediate threat is neutralized.
- **On Trivial Matters:** Applying deep, long-term thinking to insignificant decisions (e.g., what to eat for lunch) is a waste of cognitive resources.

**Keywords for Situations:** 
Policy making, business strategy, personal finance, environmental planning, long-term decisions.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Identify the Decision and First-Order Consequence:** State the action you are considering and its most immediate, obvious result. (e.g., "If we lower our prices, we will sell more units.")
2. **Ask "And then what?":** What happens as a result of that first consequence? (e.g., "Our competitors might also lower their prices.")
3. **Continue Asking "And then what?":** Trace the chain of effects further. What is the third-order consequence? (e.g., "A price war could start, eroding profit margins for the entire industry.")
4. **Consider the Full System:** Think about how your decision will affect other parts of the system (other people, departments, the market, the environment).
5. **Evaluate the Full Chain of Consequences:** Weigh the desirable first-order effect against the potentially undesirable second- and third-order effects to make a more robust decision.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "That's the immediate benefit. What happens after that?"	
- "What are the potential ripple effects of this decision in six months? In a year?"
- "Who else will be affected by this, and how might they react?"
- "What is a likely unintended consequence of this action?"
- "Let's think about a time a similar decision led to a surprising outcome. What happened?"
