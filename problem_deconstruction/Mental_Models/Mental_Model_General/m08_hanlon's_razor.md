## Mental Model = Hanlon's Razor

**Category = General Thinking Tools**
**Description:** 
Hanlon's Razor is a mental model that advises: "Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity" (or incompetence, ignorance, or neglect). It suggests that when something goes wrong or someone acts in a way that negatively affects you, it's far more likely to be the result of a mistake or oversight than a deliberate attempt to cause you harm.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When Faced with Repeated Negative Behavior:** If a person or system repeatedly causes the same negative outcome, it is no longer a random mistake. The cause may be systemic incompetence or, in some cases, malice. Don't let the razor justify inaction in the face of patterns.
- **In Adversarial Contexts:** In situations that are explicitly competitive or adversarial (e.g., a zero-sum negotiation, warfare), assuming your opponent is not acting maliciously is naive and dangerous.

**Keywords for Situations:** 
Interpersonal conflicts, workplace communication, customer service issues, interpreting others' actions.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Observe a Negative Outcome:** Notice a situation where someone's action (or inaction) has caused a problem.
2. **Resist the Malice Assumption:** Your immediate emotional reaction might be to assume the person did it on purpose to hurt or disrespect you. Actively pause this assumption.
3. **Brainstorm Alternative Explanations:** What other factors could have led to this outcome? Consider ignorance (they didn't know), incompetence (they tried but failed), distraction (they were busy/overwhelmed), or different priorities.
4. **Default to the Most Charitable Explanation:** Assume the most likely cause is a non-malicious one, like a simple mistake, until you have strong evidence to the contrary.
5. **Respond with Curiosity, Not Accusation:** Approach the person to understand their perspective. Instead of saying, "Why did you ignore my email?" try, "I was wondering if you had a chance to see my email?"

**Coaching Questions:**
- "Before we assume they are trying to sabotage us, what are some other possible explanations for their behavior?"
- "Is it possible this was just an honest mistake?"
- "What might be going on in their world that could have led to this oversight?"
- "If we assume good intent, how does that change our interpretation of this event?"
- "Could this be explained by a simple miscommunication rather than a malicious act?"
