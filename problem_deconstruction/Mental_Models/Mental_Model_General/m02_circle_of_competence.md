## Mental Model = Circle of Competence

**Category = General Thinking Tools**
**Description:** 
This model, famously advocated by Warren Buffett, emphasizes the importance of knowing the boundaries of your own knowledge and skills. It's about being brutally honest about what you understand deeply and what you don't. Making critical decisions outside your circle of competence is a recipe for disaster, as you risk operating on flawed assumptions and partial knowledge.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When Exploring New Domains:** The model should not be used as an excuse to avoid learning. Deliberately stepping outside your circle is a prerequisite for growth and innovation.
- **In Collaborative Teams:** In a team setting, the focus should be on the collective circle of competence. Deferring to others' expertise is more important than staying within your own individual circle.

**Keywords for Situations:** 
Investing, career choices, business strategy, decision-making, giving advice.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Define Your Core Competencies:** Make a list of subjects, skills, or industries where you have genuine, deep expertise built through experience and study.
2. **Define Your Boundaries:** Be explicit about what you _don't_ know. List areas where you have only surface-level knowledge or are a complete novice.
3. **Operate Within the Circle:** When making high-stakes decisions, heavily favor options that fall squarely within your circle of competence.
4. **Expand the Circle Deliberately:** If you need to venture into a new area, do so with caution and a commitment to deep learning. Don't confuse casual interest with competence.
5. **Consult Experts:** When a decision must be made outside your circle, seek out and listen to true experts who have that area within their own circle of competence.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "Is this decision within our core area of expertise?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how well do you truly understand this subject?"
- "Could you explain the arguments of the opposing side better than they could?" (Charlie Munger's test).
- "What are the unknown unknowns for us in this situation?"
- "Are we making this decision based on genuine competence or on a feeling of confidence?"
