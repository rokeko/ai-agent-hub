## Mental Model = Algorithms

**Category = Systems Thinking**
**Description:**
An algorithm is a recipe: a finite sequence of well-defined, unambiguous instructions to solve a problem or perform a computation. More than just directions, algorithms are "if-then" machines that process inputs and reliably produce a desired output, tuning out noise to focus on the signal. Thinking algorithmically involves creating and following processes that produce consistent, predictable results.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **For Complex, Adaptive Problems:** Rigid algorithms are ill-suited for problems that require creativity, empathy, or strategic judgment in dynamically changing environments.
- **When the "Why" is Lost:** Mindlessly following an algorithm without understanding the principles behind it can lead to catastrophic errors when the context changes slightly.
- **Garbage In, Garbage Out:** An algorithm is only as good as the data it's given. If the inputs are flawed, the output will be flawed, no matter how elegant the algorithm.

**Keywords for Situations:**
Process design, standard operating procedures (SOPs), computer science, automation, decision-making frameworks, checklists, problem-solving.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Define the Goal:** What specific, measurable outcome are you trying to achieve?
2. **Identify the Inputs:** What information or resources are available at the start of the process?
3. **Specify the Steps:** Write down a clear, sequential set of "if-then" instructions. There should be no ambiguity. Anyone following the steps should arrive at the same result.
4. **Define the Output:** What does the successful completion of the algorithm look like?
5. **Test and Refine:** Run the algorithm with different inputs to check for edge cases and unexpected failures. Refine the steps to make it more robust.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "Can we define a step-by-step process for this task that would guarantee success every time?"
- "What is the 'if-then' logic we are using to make this decision?"
- "Are we treating this problem like it has a simple, algorithmic solution when it actually requires judgment and adaptation?"
- "What are the failure modes of our current process (algorithm)?"
- "If we had to write this procedure down so a new person could execute it flawlessly, what would it say?"
