## Mental Model = Scale

**Category = Systems Thinking**
**Description:**
Systems change as they scale, and the properties of a system at one scale don't necessarily translate to another. Scaling is not just about doing more of the same; it often requires fundamental changes in process and structure to handle the increased load. What works for a small system can break at larger volumes. Therefore, it is crucial to anticipate new problems, identify potential bottlenecks, and be prepared to re-engineer processes when scaling.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When Assuming Linearity:** Believing that you can scale a system by simply multiplying its inputs is a common fallacy. This ignores the non-linear effects that emerge at different scales.
- **Premature Optimization for Scale:** Building a massively scalable system before you have a proven product or demand can be a waste of resources. It's often better to start with a simpler system and adapt.
- **Ignoring the Downsides of Scale:** Larger systems can be more complex, slower to change, and less resilient than smaller ones. Scale isn't always better.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Define the Current Scale:** What are the current inputs, outputs, and processes of the system?
2. **Envision the Target Scale:** What does the system look like at 10x, 100x, or 1000x its current size?
3. **Identify Breaking Points:** What parts of the current system will fail under the increased load? (e.g., communication, infrastructure, decision-making). These are your future bottlenecks.
4. **Distinguish "Scaling" from "Growing":** Are you just adding more units (growing), or do you need to change the fundamental way the system operates (scaling)?
5. **Plan for Phase Transitions:** Acknowledge that as you scale, you may need to completely replace old processes with new ones designed for the new level of complexity.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "If we had 100 times the number of customers tomorrow, what would be the first thing to break?"
- "Is our current plan for growth just 'more of the same,' or have we considered how the system itself needs to change?"
- "What are the benefits of staying at our current scale?"
- "Are we building for a level of scale that we don't actually need yet?"
- "How does our communication and decision-making process need to change as we get bigger?"
