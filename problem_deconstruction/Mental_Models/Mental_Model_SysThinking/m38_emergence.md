## Mental Model = Emergence

**Category = Systems Thinking**
**Description:**
Emergence is the phenomenon where complex systems and patterns arise out of a multiplicity of relatively simple interactions. The resulting "emergent" properties, like the consciousness from neurons or the flocking of birds, are more than the sum of their parts and cannot be predicted by analyzing the individual components in isolation. Using this model is less about prediction and more about acknowledging the possibility of novel outcomes when components are combined in new ways.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When Needing Predictable Outcomes:** If you require a specific, predictable result, relying on emergence is not a sound strategy. Emergence is, by its nature, often surprising.
- **As an Excuse for a Lack of Planning:** While emergence can lead to wonderful, unplanned discoveries, it should not be used as a justification for a complete lack of vision or strategy.
- **When Ignoring the Initial Conditions:** The properties that emerge are highly dependent on the initial components and the rules of their interaction. Ignoring these fundamentals can lead to undesirable emergent behavior.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Identify the Components:** What are the individual agents or parts of the system? (e.g., people, lines of code, cells).
2. **Define the Simple Rules of Interaction:** How do the components interact with each other and their immediate environment?
3. **Observe the Macro-Level Behavior:** Step back and look at the system as a whole. What larger patterns or behaviors are emerging from the simple interactions?
4. **Foster, Don't Force:** You often cannot design an emergent outcome directly. Instead, create an environment and tweak the simple rules to make the desired outcome more likely to emerge.
5. **Embrace Serendipity:** Be open to unexpected and novel results. The most valuable emergent properties are often the ones you didn't plan for.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "Instead of designing the outcome from the top down, what simple rules could we put in place at the individual level to see what emerges?"
- "What are the unintended (but potentially useful) behaviors we are seeing in our team/product/system?"
- "Are we trying to over-manage this system, when we should be letting a solution emerge?"
- "How can we increase the diversity of components and interactions to create the potential for more interesting emergent properties?"
- "What if the solution to our problem isn't a single, grand plan, but a result of many small, interacting parts?"
