## Mental Model = Feedback Loops

**Category = Systems Thinking**
**Description:** 
Feedback loops are the engines of growth and change, mechanisms where a system's output influences its input. In complex systems with many loops, it's hard to see how one adjustment affects the whole. This model encourages noticing daily feedback, valuing iteration, and strategically directing system changes based on the feedback you receive and its impact. They are what make systems dynamic; without them, systems are static. Understanding, respecting, and wisely using feedback loops is key.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **In Simple, Linear Systems:** For straightforward cause-and-effect relationships without recursive influence, applying a feedback loop model can overcomplicate the analysis.
- **When Overlooking External Factors:** Focusing solely on internal feedback can lead to ignoring significant external changes or inputs that affect the system.
- **When it Leads to Over-Correction:** Acting on every piece of feedback, especially in systems with delays, can lead to instability and wild oscillations (e.g., bullwhip effect in supply chains).

**Keywords for Situations:**
Habit formation, product development, organizational change, system dynamics, learning processes, self-reinforcing cycles, balancing forces.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Identify the System:** What system are you trying to understand or change? (e.g., your morning routine, a team's workflow, a market).
2. **Map the Loops:** What are the key outputs? How do those outputs feed back to influence the inputs? Are the loops reinforcing (amplifying change) or balancing (stabilizing the system)?
3. **Look for Delays:** Is there a time lag between the output and its influence on the input? Delays can cause unexpected behavior.
4. **Identify Leverage Points:** Where in the loop can a small change have the largest effect? This could be changing the goal of the loop, the speed of the feedback, or the way information flows.
5. **Test and Observe:** Make a small change at a leverage point and observe the system's response. Learn from the feedback and iterate.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "What is the output of this system, and how does it circle back to affect the input?"
- "Is this a reinforcing loop that's amplifying growth or decline, or a balancing loop that's creating stability?"
- "What are the unintended consequences of the current feedback structure?"
- "If we want to change the outcome, where is the most effective place to intervene in the loop?"
- "Are we reacting too quickly to feedback, or is there a delay we're not accounting for?"
