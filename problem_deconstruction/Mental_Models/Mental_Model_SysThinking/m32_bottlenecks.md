## Mental Model = Bottlenecks

**Category = Systems Thinking**
**Description:**
A bottleneck is a choke point in a system that limits flow and determines the system's overall capacity—the weakest link in the chain. The key leverage point for improving any system is identifying and alleviating its bottleneck. However, not all bottlenecks are bad; some are intentional and necessary for quality or safety (e.g., a security checkpoint). The goal is to be intentional about your bottlenecks, ensuring they serve a purpose, as an accidental bottleneck is merely a drag on the system.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When Misidentifying the Bottleneck:** Applying resources to a part of the system that isn't the true bottleneck will not improve the system's overall throughput and is a waste of effort.
- **When the "Fix" Creates a New Bottleneck:** Sometimes, "fixing" one bottleneck can create a new, even more restrictive one elsewhere in the system.
- **Ignoring "Good" Bottlenecks:** Removing a necessary bottleneck (like a quality assurance step) can increase speed at the cost of quality, safety, or stability.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Map the Process Flow:** Visualize the steps required to get from start to finish.
2. **Identify the Constraint:** Where does work pile up? What part of the process has the longest queue or the slowest cycle time? This is your bottleneck.
3. **Exploit the Bottleneck:** Ensure the bottleneck is always working at 100% capacity on the most important tasks. Don't let it sit idle.
4. **Subordinate Everything Else:** The speed of the entire system should be paced to the speed of the bottleneck. There's no use in other parts of the system going faster, as it will just create more work-in-progress inventory.
5. **Elevate the Bottleneck:** If you have fully exploited the bottleneck and still need more throughput, invest in improving it—add resources, training, or better tools.
6. **Repeat:** Once a bottleneck is elevated, a new constraint will appear elsewhere. Repeat the process.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "If we could only speed up one part of this process, which one would have the biggest impact on the final output?"
- "Where is work piling up in our system?"
- "Is this bottleneck a bug or a feature? Is it slowing us down in a way that is actually useful?"
- "How can we ensure our most constrained resource is never waiting for work?"
- "What would happen if we completely fixed this bottleneck? Where would the new one appear?"
