## Mental Model = Law of Diminishing Returns

**Category = Systems Thinking**
**Description:**
The law of diminishing returns states that as you add more of one input to a system while keeping other inputs constant, the marginal benefit from each new input will eventually decline. The first efforts yield the largest gains (going from bad to good is easier than good to great), but as you continue to optimize, it takes more and more work to get smaller and smaller improvements. Understanding this is crucial for allocating resources efficiently, knowing where to focus your efforts for the biggest impact, and recognizing when it's time to stop optimizing and move on.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **In Systems with Increasing Returns:** In some systems, particularly those with network effects, the initial returns are small, but they accelerate as more inputs are added. Applying this model here could cause you to give up too early.
- **When "Good Enough" Isn't:** In situations where perfection is required (e.g., safety-critical systems), you cannot stop optimizing just because the returns are diminishing.
- **When Misidentifying the Input:** If you are adding the wrong input, you might see diminishing returns, but that's a sign of a flawed strategy, not a fundamental limit of the system.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Identify the Input:** What variable are you adding to the system? (e.g., hours of study, marketing spend, number of developers).
2. **Measure the Output:** What is the result you are trying to achieve? (e.g., test score, new customers, feature velocity).
3. **Track the Marginal Return:** As you add each unit of input, how much output do you get? Is the gain from each new unit increasing, decreasing, or staying the same?
4. **Find the Point of Diminishing Returns:** Identify where the returns start to level off. This is the "good enough" point for many situations.
5. **Evaluate the Opportunity Cost:** Is the effort required for the next small improvement worth it, or could that effort be better spent on something else with higher potential returns?

**Coaching Questions:**
- "Are we still getting a significant 'bang for our buck' from our efforts here?"
- "At what point does the effort to improve this outweigh the benefit?"
- "Is this a situation where we need to push through the diminishing returns to achieve excellence, or is 'good enough' acceptable?"
- "Where are the 'easy wins' in our current set of problems?"
- "Could the resources we are spending on this last 10% of optimization be better used to start something new?"
