## Mental Model = Critical Mass

**Category = Systems Thinking**
**Description:**
Critical mass is the tipping point where a system's behavior fundamentally changes, shifting from a linear, sputtering process to a self-sustaining, explosive reaction. It's the minimum amount of a resource (e.g., users, effort, capital) needed to trigger this change. Understanding critical mass helps in identifying the necessary inputs and design changes required to achieve a desired, sustainable outcome.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When Underestimating the Required Mass:** Misjudging the amount of effort or resources needed to reach the tipping point can lead to giving up just before success.
- **When the "Explosion" is Undesirable:** Not all self-sustaining reactions are good. A viral rumor or a market panic also operates on the principle of critical mass.
- **Forgetting About Post-Critical Mass Dynamics:** Reaching critical mass is not the end of the story. The system will have new properties and challenges that need to be managed.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Identify the Desired Self-Sustaining Reaction:** What process do you want to become self-perpetuating? (e.g., user growth, cultural change).
2. **Define the "Mass":** What is the key resource that needs to accumulate? (e.g., active users, committed team members, capital investment).
3. **Estimate the Tipping Point:** How much of this resource is "enough"? This is often difficult to pinpoint precisely, so it's a matter of educated estimation and observation.
4. **Concentrate Your Resources:** Instead of spreading your efforts thinly, focus all your energy on reaching critical mass in a specific, targeted area.
5. **Prepare for the Aftermath:** What will you do once the reaction becomes self-sustaining? How will you manage the growth?

**Coaching Questions:**
- "What is the one resource we need more of to make this effort self-sustaining?"
- "Have we reached the tipping point yet, or are we still in the 'sputtering along' phase?"
- "Instead of trying to grow everywhere at once, where can we focus our energy to achieve critical mass?"
- "What happens if we succeed? Are we prepared to handle that level of growth?"
- "Is there a risk of reaching critical mass for an outcome we *don't* want?"
