## Mental Model = Churn

**Category = Systems Thinking**
**Description:**
Churn is the rate at which components leave a system, often seen as the slow, silent attrition of customers or employees that can undermine growth. While high churn is often a "silent killer," it can also present opportunities. Like a snake shedding its skin, some level of churn is natural and can be healthy, allowing for the replacement of worn-out parts and the introduction of new ideas and capabilities. The key is managing the rate: some churn is inevitable and even beneficial; too much can be fatal.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When Focusing Only on the Negative:** Viewing all churn as failure can lead to retaining mismatched customers or low-performing employees, which can be more damaging than letting them go.
- **When Ignoring the "Why":** Measuring churn without understanding the root causes behind it is a vanity metric. You must dig into why people are leaving to make effective changes.
- **In Early Stages:** In the very beginning of a project or company, churn might be high and erratic. Over-analyzing it before you have a stable product or system can be misleading.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Measure the Churn Rate:** What is the percentage of components (customers, employees, etc.) leaving the system over a specific period?
2. **Segment the Churn:** Is churn concentrated in a particular group? (e.g., new customers, specific departments). This helps identify the source of the problem.
3. **Analyze the "Why":** Gather feedback from those who are leaving. What are the push and pull factors? What is driving the attrition?
4. **Distinguish Good vs. Bad Churn:** Is this "good churn" (e.g., removing customers who are a poor fit) or "bad churn" (losing valuable contributors)?
5. **Develop a Retention/Renewal Strategy:** Based on your analysis, implement targeted strategies to reduce bad churn and encourage the healthy renewal of the system.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "What is our churn rate, and more importantly, why are people leaving?"
- "Are we losing the people we want to keep, or the ones we are better off without?"
- "Instead of just focusing on acquisition, what is our plan to reduce the number of people heading for the exit?"
- "What could we learn if we talked to the last 10 customers who churned?"
- "Is our current level of churn a sign of a terminal illness or a healthy process of renewal?"
