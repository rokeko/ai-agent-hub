## Mental Model = Regression to the Mean

**Category = Mathematics**
**Description:** 
Regression to the mean is the statistical tendency for an extreme or unusual result to be followed by a result that is closer to the long-term average. If a variable is extreme on its first measurement, it will tend to be closer to the average on its second measurement—and, paradoxically, if it is extreme on its second measurement, it will tend to have been closer to the average on its first. It reminds us that outlier events are often just that—outliers—and not necessarily indicative of a new, permanent level of performance.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When There is a Real Change:** If a fundamental factor has changed (e.g., a new technology is adopted, an athlete gets a new coach), the "mean" itself may have shifted. Don't dismiss genuine improvement as simply regression.
- **To Justify Inaction:** Assuming a terrible result will simply "regress" back to good performance can be an excuse to not address underlying problems.
- **When Misinterpreting Cause and Effect:** We often invent causal stories for regression. For example, praising someone after a great performance, and then seeing their next performance is more average, and concluding praise is bad. The regression to the mean would have happened anyway.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Identify an Outlier:** Notice an event or performance that is significantly above or below the average.
2. **Analyze the Role of Chance:** To what extent could this extreme outcome be attributed to luck or random factors, as opposed to pure skill or a fundamental change?
3. **Expect a Return to Average:** Instead of extrapolating the extreme result into the future, predict that the next data point will likely be closer to the historical average.
4. **Avoid Creating False Narratives:** Don't invent complex causal explanations for why the extreme event was followed by a more normal one. The statistical tendency is often explanation enough.
5. **Calibrate Your Judgment:** Don't over-reward a lucky success or over-punish an unlucky failure. Base your judgment on long-term patterns, not short-term outliers.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "Is this outstanding/terrible performance repeatable, or is it an outlier we should expect to regress to the mean?"
- "Are we sure our intervention caused this improvement, or was the subject just having a bad day and naturally got better?"
- "Before we make a big decision based on this one data point, what does the long-term average tell us?"
- "Could we be creating a superstition by linking our action to what is just a natural statistical tendency?"
- "How can we separate the signal (true performance) from the noise (random fluctuations) in this situation?"
