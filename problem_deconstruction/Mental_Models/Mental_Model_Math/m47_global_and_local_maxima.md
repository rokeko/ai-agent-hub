## Mental Model = Global and Local Maxima

**Category = Mathematics**
**Description:** 
This model describes the difference between a good solution (a local maximum) and the best possible solution (the global maximum). In any complex system you are trying to optimize, it's easy to find a "peak" of good performance and stop there, assuming you've reached the best outcome. However, a higher peak—the global maximum—may exist elsewhere. To find it often requires a counterintuitive step: moving "downhill" away from your current good solution to explore the broader landscape for a better one.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When "Good Enough" is Sufficient:** The search for the global maximum can be costly and time-consuming. If a local maximum already meets all necessary conditions, the search for perfection can be a waste of resources.
- **In Rapidly Changing Landscapes:** If the environment is changing quickly, the location of the global maximum may be constantly shifting. A strategy of continuous small improvements (climbing the nearest hill) might be more effective.
- **When the Downhill is a Death Valley:** The short-term dip required to search for a higher peak might be fatal. If you are in a precarious situation, securing the gains from a local maximum might be the only viable option.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Identify Your Current Peak:** What is your current strategy or solution? How successful is it? Acknowledge that you are likely on a local maximum.
2. **Define the "Search Cost":** What would it cost (in time, money, or performance) to temporarily abandon your current peak to try something new?
3. **Introduce Deliberate Exploration:** How can you explore the landscape? Dedicate a portion of your resources (e.g., 10% of your time) to trying radically different approaches that are not just small improvements on your current method.
4. **Evaluate New Peaks:** When you find a new potential solution, assess its height. Is it truly a higher peak, or just a different local maximum?
5. **Balance Exploration vs. Exploitation:** Consciously decide how many resources to devote to "exploiting" your current known peak versus "exploring" for new, potentially higher ones.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "Are we sure this is the best way to do this, or is it just the way we've always done it?"
- "What would happen if we deliberately did the opposite of our current strategy for a week?"
- "To find a 10x better solution, we might have to get 20% worse first. Are we willing to do that?"
- "Are we stuck on a local peak? How can we get a better view of the entire landscape?"
- "Is this truly the best we can do, or have we just stopped looking for a better way?"
