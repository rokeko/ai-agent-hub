## Mental Model = Sampling

**Category = Mathematics**
**Description:**
Sampling is the process of selecting a subset of individuals from within a statistical population to estimate characteristics of the whole population. The core idea is that by studying a representative sample, we can make inferences about a much larger group without needing to examine every single member. A key factor is the sample size; larger, more representative samples generally lead to more accurate conclusions, but at a higher cost in time and resources. A critical error is drawing firm conclusions from a sample that is too small or biased.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **In Highly Diverse Populations:** If the group you are studying has many different segments, a simple random sample may not capture the full picture. Stratified sampling might be needed.
- **When the Stakes are Extremely High:** For critical, irreversible decisions, relying on a sample might be too risky. A full census (if possible) might be required.
- **When Bias Cannot be Controlled:** If you cannot ensure the sample is representative and free from biases (like selection bias or survivorship bias), the conclusions will be unreliable.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Define the Population:** What is the entire group you want to understand or make a decision about?
2. **Assess the Sample:** How was the sample selected? Is it representative of the population? What is the sample size?
3. **Identify Potential Biases:** What factors might have skewed the sample? Is there survivorship bias? Selection bias? Is the data collection method itself introducing bias?
4. **Evaluate the Conclusion:** Is the conclusion drawn from the sample appropriate? Does it account for uncertainty and margins of error?
5. **Balance Cost and Confidence:** What is the trade-off between the cost of collecting more data (a larger sample) and the confidence required for the decision you are making?

**Coaching Questions:**
- "Are we making this decision based on a robust sample or just a few anecdotes?"
- "What is the sample size here, and is it large enough to give us confidence?"
- "How representative is this sample of our actual customers/users/situation?"
- "What biases could be influencing these results?"
- "What's the risk if this sample isn't telling us the whole story?"
