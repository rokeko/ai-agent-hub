## Mental Model = Self-Preservation

**Category = Physics, Chemistry, and Biology**
**Description:** 
Self-preservation is the fundamental instinct that drives all living organisms to protect their own existence. It is the biological imperative to survive, avoid harm, and maintain stability. In humans, this extends beyond physical safety to include the protection of our psychological identity, social status, and core beliefs. Itâ€™s the voice that tells us to be cautious and the impulse that makes us resist threats to how we see ourselves and our place in the world.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When It Prevents Necessary Risks:** An overactive self-preservation instinct can lead to stagnation. By focusing exclusively on avoiding threats, we miss the opportunities that are essential for growth and success.
- **When It Defends the Ego:** Often, what we are preserving is not our physical safety but our ego or a cherished belief. This can make us defensive, resistant to feedback, and unable to learn.
- **When the "Threat" is Change:** Self-preservation can make us cling to the status quo, even when change is necessary for survival in the long run. We protect what is familiar, not necessarily what is optimal.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Identify the Feeling:** When you feel resistance or fear, recognize it as the self-preservation instinct at work.
2. **Distinguish the Threat:** Is this a threat to your physical survival, or is it a threat to your ego, status, or comfort? Be honest about what you are truly trying to protect.
3. **Calculate the Cost of Inaction:** Consider the risk of *not* taking the risk. What opportunities will you miss? What is the long-term cost of staying in your comfort zone?
4. **Separate the Signal from the Noise:** The instinct provides a signal (caution!). Listen to the signal, but don't let it be the only voice. Evaluate the threat rationally, rather than reacting emotionally.
5. **Take a Calculated Step:** Find a small, manageable way to move forward despite the feeling of risk. The goal is not to be reckless, but to avoid being paralyzed by fear.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "What am I really afraid of losing here?"
- "Is this instinct protecting me from real harm, or just from discomfort?"
- "What is the risk of doing nothing?"
- "If I wasn't afraid, what would I do?"
- "How can I test this situation with a small, calculated risk?"
