## Mental Model = Reciprocity

**Category = Physics, Chemistry, and Biology**
**Description:** 
Reciprocity is the principle that we tend to treat others as they treat us. It's a powerful social dynamic that creates a feedback loop in relationships, collaborations, and systems: what you give is often what you get back. From simple kindness to complex negotiations, reciprocity shapes our interactions by establishing an implicit system of exchange. It teaches that our actions are not isolated events but part of an interconnected web where we influence our own outcomes.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **In Negative Cycles:** Mindlessly reciprocating negative behavior (cynicism, hostility) only escalates conflict and creates a destructive tit-for-tat loop.
- **When It Can Be Exploited:** Be cautious of individuals or systems that exploit the tendency for reciprocity by making a small gesture to demand a much larger, disproportionate return.
- **When a Relationship is Asymmetrical:** In situations with a significant power imbalance, what seems like reciprocity can be a form of manipulation or coercion.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Go First and Be Positive:** Instead of waiting for others, initiate the cycle you want to create. Offer trust, kindness, or value first, without an immediate expectation of return.
2. **Mirror the Desired Behavior:** Consciously act in the way you want to be treated. If you want others to listen, listen to them. If you want respect, be respectful.
3. **Focus on Deserving, Not Receiving:** Shift your focus from what you can get to what you can give. The most reliable way to achieve success or a positive outcome is to first deserve it through your own actions and contributions.
4. **Recognize the Loop:** When you find yourself in a situation, ask what kind of reciprocal loop is at play. Is it positive and reinforcing, or negative and destructive?
5. **Break Negative Cycles:** If you are in a negative loop, refuse to reciprocate in kind. Instead, introduce a different, more constructive behavior to try and reset the dynamic.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "Am I waiting for the other person to go first?"
- "What am I currently giving that I see reflected back at me?"
- "To get what I want from this relationship or situation, what should I be giving?"
- "Are my actions creating a positive or negative feedback loop?"
- "Instead of just reacting, how can I proactively start the cycle I want?"
