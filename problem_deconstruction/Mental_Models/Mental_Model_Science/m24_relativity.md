## Mental Model = Relativity

**Category = Physics, Chemistry, and Biology**
**Description:** 
Relativity is the principle that our perception and judgment are not absolute but are shaped by our unique point of view and frame of reference. Two people can witness the same event and have vastly different interpretations because their context, experiences, and values are different. Understanding this subjectivity is crucial for empathy, communication, and making more robust judgments. It's recognizing that we all have blind spots and that our view is not the complete picture.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When Confused with Relativism:** Relativity should not be mistaken for the idea that all perspectives are equally valid or true (relativism). Recognizing that perspectives differ doesn't mean abandoning critical judgment or the pursuit of objective facts.
- **As an Excuse for Inaction:** Using relativity to argue that "everyone has their own truth" can be a cop-out that prevents making necessary judgments or taking a moral stance.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Acknowledge Your Frame of Reference:** Start by asking, "From what perspective am I seeing this? What are the experiences and assumptions that shape my view?"
2. **Actively Seek Other Perspectives:** Intentionally look for people with different backgrounds and experiences. Ask them how they see the situation.
3. **Identify the Differences:** Compare your perspective with others. What do they see that you don't? What do they value that you don't? Where do your frames of reference diverge?
4. **Find the "Absolute" Data:** What are the objective facts that exist independent of any one perspective? (e.g., in a room where one person feels hot and another cold, the absolute temperature is a fixed number).
5. **Integrate and Update:** Use the insights from other perspectives to expand your own understanding. This doesn't mean you must adopt their view, but you should use it to see your own blind spots and create a more complete picture.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "How would someone with a completely different background see this situation?"
- "What are my blind spots here?"
- "Before I make a judgment, have I truly tried to understand the other person's frame of reference?"
- "What objective facts can we agree on, even if our interpretations differ?"
- "What if the opposite of my perspective were true? What would that look like?"
