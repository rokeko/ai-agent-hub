## Mental Model = Catalysts

**Category = Physics, Chemistry, and Biology**
**Description:** 
A catalyst is a substance or agent that accelerates a chemical reaction without being consumed by it. In broader terms, a catalyst is a person, event, or technology that precipitates significant change or action without necessarily being a major part of the final outcome. They lower the activation energy required for a change to occur, making it faster, more likely, or even possible in the first place.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **Unintended Consequences:** Introducing a catalyst can have unforeseen side effects. The change might be accelerated in an undesirable direction.
- **Creating Dependency:** Relying on a specific catalyst (e.g., one charismatic leader) can make a system fragile. When the catalyst is removed, the process may grind to a halt.

**Keywords for Situations:**
Leadership, innovation, social change, personal development, process improvement, mentorship.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Identify the Desired Reaction:** What change or process are you trying to accelerate or enable?
2. **Assess the Current "Reaction Rate":** How quickly is this change happening on its own? Is it stalled? Is the activation energy too high?
3. **Find a Potential Catalyst:** What person, idea, technology, or event could you introduce to speed things up? Look for something that can connect disparate parts, provide a missing resource, or inspire action.
4. **Introduce the Catalyst Strategically:** Apply the catalyst at the right time and place to have the maximum impact. 
5. **Observe the Effect:** Monitor the situation to see if the catalyst is working as intended. Is the reaction speeding up? Are there any negative side effects?

**Coaching Questions:**
- "What is the 'reaction' we want to happen here, and why is it so slow?"
- "What is the smallest intervention we could make that would have the largest impact on the speed of this change?"
- "Who or what could act as a catalyst for this team/project?"
- "Are we the bottleneck? How could we act as a catalyst to empower others?"
- "Is this proposed change a true catalyst, or just another ingredient that will complicate the reaction?"
