## Mental Model = Inertia

**Category = Physics, Chemistry, and Biology**
**Description:** 
Inertia is the resistance to change. Objects (and systems) at rest stay at rest, and those in motion stay in motion. It's a fundamental property of mass, but it's also a powerful metaphor for understanding resistance to change in habits, organizations, and beliefs. The more "mass" a habit or institution has (e.g., the longer it's existed), the more force is required to change its direction.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When Facing Disruption:** Relying on past momentum can be disastrous when the environment changes. Successful companies can fail if their inertia prevents them from adapting to new technologies or market shifts.
- **When Bad Habits are Entrenched:** Personal and organizational inertia can keep destructive habits in place. The "we've always done it this way" mentality is a classic sign of dangerous inertia.
- **When Agility is Required:** In dynamic environments, inertia is a liability. Startups often succeed because their lack of inertia allows them to pivot and adapt quickly, while larger incumbents are slowed by their own momentum.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Identify the Existing Inertia:** What is the current state of motion? What direction is the momentum carrying you or your organization? Is it at rest or moving?
2. **Assess the "Mass":** How entrenched is the current state? How long have these habits, processes, or beliefs been in place? This will determine the amount of force needed for change.
3. **Apply a Concentrated Force (to start):** To overcome static inertia, a significant initial push is often required. What is the "activation energy" needed to get things moving in a new direction?
4. **Break it Down:** To overcome the initial resistance, break the desired change into the smallest possible steps. Starting a new habit with a single push-up is easier than starting with fifty. This reduces the initial force required.
5. **Build Momentum in the Right Direction:** Once in motion, focus on small, consistent wins to build momentum (the "flywheel effect"). Inertia will then start to work for you, making it easier to continue in the new direction and harder to be stopped.
6. **Leverage Lack of Inertia:** If you are a startup or a new team, recognize your lack of inertia as a strength. Your ability to be agile and change direction quickly is a competitive advantage against larger, more inert competitors.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "Is our current momentum carrying us in the right direction?"
- "What's the smallest possible step we can take to start moving in a new direction?"
- "Are we struggling against inertia, or is it working for us?"
- "Where is the 'we've always done it this way' mentality holding us back?"
- "How can we use our agility (lack of inertia) as an advantage against our competitors?"
