## Mental Model = Velocity

**Category = Physics, Chemistry, and Biology**
**Description:** 
Velocity is not just speed; it is speed in a specific direction. While speed measures how fast something is moving, velocity measures the rate of progress toward a particular destination. As a mental model, it teaches that being busy or moving fast is not the same as making progress. True velocity requires a clear goal (direction) and a measure of how quickly you are approaching it. It's the key differentiator between aimless motion and focused advancement.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When Direction is Unclear:** Applying massive effort to increase speed is wasted and even counterproductive if you are heading in the wrong direction.
- **At the Expense of Sustainability:** A relentless focus on maximizing velocity can lead to burnout, poor quality, and cutting corners that compromise long-term success.
- **When It Prevents Observation:** Moving too fast can prevent you from seeing new information, changing conditions, or better destinations. Sometimes you need to slow down to make sure you're still on the right path.

**Keywords for Situations:**
Strategy, goal setting, progress measurement, efficiency, prioritization, focus, speed vs. direction.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Set the Destination (Direction):** First and foremost, what is your goal? What does "done" or "success" look like? Define your trajectory.
2. **Measure Your Current Velocity:** How quickly are you currently moving toward your goal? Establish a baseline.
3. **Apply Force to Increase Speed:** Identify the key activities that will propel you toward your destination and invest more effort and resources in them.
4. **Remove Friction to Increase Speed:** What obstacles, distractions, or inefficiencies are slowing you down? Eliminate them to make progress smoother and faster.
5. **Constantly Course Correct:** Regularly check your progress against your destination. Is new information available? Do you need to adjust your direction?

**Coaching Questions:**
- "Are we confusing activity with progress?"
- "What is our destination, and is every action we're taking moving us closer to it?"
- "Are we going fast in the wrong direction?"
- "What's the biggest source of 'drag' slowing us down right now?"
- "If we could only do one thing to increase our velocity toward our goal, what would it be?"
