## Mental Model = Incentives

**Category = Physics, Chemistry, and Biology**
**Description:** 
Incentives are the hidden engines that drive behavior. They are the unseen forces, both explicit (like a sales bonus) and subtle (like social approval), that shape our choices by tapping into our fundamental wiring to seek reward and avoid punishment. When incentives are aligned with desired goals, systems thrive. When they are misaligned, they create struggle and inefficiency. The core principle is that if you understand the incentive, you can often predict the outcome.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When They Are Poorly Designed:** Poorly designed incentives can backfire, encouraging short-term thinking, unethical behavior, or other unintended consequences (e.g., rewarding code quantity over quality).
- **When Short-Term and Long-Term Incentives Conflict:** Many systems reward immediate gratification (pleasure of immediate gains) at the expense of long-term success (being healthy as you age). This misalignment is a primary source of failure.
- **When They Crowd Out Intrinsic Motivation:** Relying solely on external rewards can diminish a person's natural interest or enjoyment in a task.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Identify the Desired Outcome:** What specific behavior or result are you trying to achieve?
2. **Analyze the Current Incentives:** What are the existing rewards and punishments in the system, both formal and informal? What behaviors are currently being encouraged?
3. **Map Incentives to Actors:** Who are the key players in the system, and what motivates them individually? (e.g., money, status, autonomy, purpose).
4. **Design Aligned Incentives:** Create a system of rewards and punishments that directly encourages the desired outcome. Consider both tangible and intangible rewards.
5. **Stress-Test for Unintended Consequences:** Ask "How could this be gamed?" or "What's the worst thing someone could do while trying to get this reward?" Identify and mitigate potential negative behaviors.
6. **Align Time Horizons:** Ensure that short-term rewards do not undermine long-term goals. Create incentives for patience and long-term thinking.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome. What outcome does our current incentive structure predict?"
- "Are we rewarding the behavior we want, or are we rewarding a proxy for it that can be easily gamed?"
- "What happens if we prioritize our long-term goal at the expense of the short-term reward today?"
- "What non-financial incentives (like recognition, autonomy, or mastery) could we use here?"
- "How might this incentive plan lead to behavior we don't want?"
