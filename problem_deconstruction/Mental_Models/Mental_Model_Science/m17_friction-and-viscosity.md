## Mental Model = Friction and Viscosity

**Category = Physics, Chemistry, and Biology**
**Description:** 
Friction and viscosity are forces that resist motion. Friction opposes the sliding of surfaces against each other, while viscosity is the internal resistance of a fluid to flow. In any system, these forces represent the costs, drags, and inefficiencies that slow down progress. Reducing friction is often a more effective strategy for improvement than simply applying more force.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When Friction is Necessary (Traction):** Not all friction is bad. It provides the grip needed to walk, for brakes to work, or for a team to gain traction on a project. Removing all friction can lead to chaos and lack of control.
- **When Reducing Friction is Too Costly:** The effort to eliminate a minor point of friction might outweigh the benefit gained from its removal.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Identify the Desired Motion:** What process, action, or outcome are you trying to achieve?
2. **Pinpoint the Friction/Viscosity:** Where does resistance occur in the system? What steps are difficult, slow, or require the most effort? What causes drag?
3. **Distinguish Good vs. Bad Friction:** Which points of friction are necessary for control, quality, or safety ("good friction")? Which are simply wasteful hindrances ("bad friction")?
4. **Reduce Bad Friction:** Brainstorm ways to make the process smoother. Can you remove steps, automate tasks, clarify instructions, or improve the tools being used?
5. **Strategically Increase Friction:** Conversely, where could you *add* friction to slow down competitors or prevent undesirable behaviors (e.g., adding a confirmation step to prevent an accidental deletion)?

**Coaching Questions:**
- "Instead of pushing harder, how could we make the path smoother?"
- "What's the single biggest point of 'drag' in this process?"
- "If we wanted to make this 10x easier for the user/team, what would we remove?"
- "Is this a form of friction that actually helps us, like the brakes on a car?"
- "How can we increase friction for our competitors or for undesirable outcomes?"
