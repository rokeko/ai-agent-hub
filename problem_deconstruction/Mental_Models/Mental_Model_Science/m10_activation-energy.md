## Mental Model = Activation Energy

**Category = Physics, Chemistry, and Biology**
**Description:** 
Activation energy is the initial spark of effort required to start a process or reaction. Just as a chemical reaction needs a certain amount of energy to begin, many tasks, projects, and habits require an upfront investment of energy to overcome inertia and get started. Once this initial barrier is overcome, the process can often continue with much less effort, driven by its own momentum.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **For Unsustainable goals:** Applying a massive burst of activation energy to a goal that is fundamentally unsustainable or poorly planned can lead to quick burnout and failure.
- **When the task is impossible:** No amount of activation energy can make an impossible task possible. It's crucial to distinguish between a high barrier to entry and a literal dead end.

**Keywords for Situations:**
Procrastination, habit formation, project initiation, innovation, change management, starting a new venture.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Identify the "Hump":** What is the initial barrier or point of friction that is preventing you from starting? Be specific about what makes the first step feel difficult.
2. **Lower the Barrier:** Break the initial task down into the smallest possible step. Make the activation energy required so low that it feels trivial to start (e.g., "just put on your running shoes," "just open the document").
3. **Apply Focused Energy:** Dedicate a specific, uninterrupted block of time to overcoming the initial hurdle. Remove distractions and commit to getting past the activation point.
4. **Don't Worry About the Finish Line:** The goal is not to complete the entire task, but simply to start it. Focus solely on getting the "reaction" going.
5. **Harness the Momentum:** Once you've started, use the momentum to carry you forward. Notice how the task feels easier once you are in motion.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "What is the smallest possible step you could take to get this started?"
- "What's the one thing that's making it feel so hard to begin?"
- "How can we make the first 10 minutes of this task as easy as possible?"
- "What would it look like if we just focused on getting over the initial hump, and nothing else?"
- "Are we failing to start because the activation energy is too high, or because the goal itself is flawed?"
