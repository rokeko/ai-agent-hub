## Mental Model = Evolution (Natural Selection and Extinction)

**Category = Physics, Chemistry, and Biology**
**Description:** 
Evolution is a process of change over time driven by natural selection. Organisms or systems with traits best suited to their environment (the "fittest") are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass on those traits. Those that are poorly adapted (the "unfit") are eliminated (extinction). This model applies not just to biology, but also to businesses, technologies, ideas, and skills, which all compete and adapt in a changing environment.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **For Short-Term Planning:** Evolution is a long-term process. Relying on it for immediate, short-term results is inappropriate. It describes a long-term trend, not a quick fix.
- **As a Justification for Ruthlessness:** Applying this model too literally to social or organizational management can foster a toxic, cutthroat culture that destroys psychological safety and cooperation.

**Keywords for Situations:**
Business strategy, market competition, innovation, product development, career planning, skill adaptation.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Define the Environment:** What is the competitive landscape or environment you are in? What are the key pressures, demands, and constraints?
2. **Identify Selection Pressures:** What specific traits are being rewarded or selected for in this environment? (e.g., speed, cost, quality, a specific skill).
3. **Assess Your "Fitness":** How well do your current traits (products, skills, strategies) match the selection pressures? Where are you strong, and where are you vulnerable to "extinction"?
4. **Encourage Variation:** How can you foster experimentation and generate new traits (new ideas, product features, business models) to test against the environment?
5. **Select and Amplify:** When a variation proves successful, how can you double down on it, scale it, and make it a core part of your strategy? Be prepared to let go of what is no longer working.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "What are the key 'selection pressures' in our market right now?"
- "Which of our current strategies or products are at risk of going 'extinct'?"
- "Are we operating in a way that is adapted to the world as it is, or the world as it used to be?"
- "How can we run more small experiments to generate the 'mutations' that might lead to a breakthrough?"
- "If we were to be wiped out, what would be the cause?"
