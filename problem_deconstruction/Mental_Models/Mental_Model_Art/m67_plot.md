## Mental Model = Plot

**Category = Art**
**Description:** 
A plot is the causal sequence of events in a narrative that moves a character from a state of equilibrium to a new state. It is the story's engine, driven by conflict. A plot is not merely "what happens next," but a chain of cause and effect where each event logically follows from the previous one. Its primary function is to create a compelling journey that tests and transforms the characters involved.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **In Slice-of-Life or Character-Driven Stories:** In narratives that focus on capturing a moment, mood, or the intricacies of a character's mind, a strong, goal-oriented plot can feel artificial and detract from the core purpose.
- **When It Becomes Too Formulaic:** An over-reliance on a predictable plot structure (e.g., a rigid three-act structure) can lead to stories that feel generic and lack surprise.

**Keywords for Situations:** 
Screenwriting, novel writing, game design, project planning, legal arguments, personal storytelling.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Establish the Protagonist and Their Goal:** Who is the story about, and what do they want more than anything? This desire is the fuel for the plot.
2. **Introduce the Inciting Incident:** What event happens that disrupts the character's ordinary world and forces them to pursue their goal? This is where the plot officially begins.
3. **Create Rising Action through Obstacles:** The character tries to achieve their goal, but a series of escalating conflicts and obstacles stands in their way. Each obstacle should force the character to make a meaningful choice.
4. **Engineer the Climax:** This is the point of maximum conflict, where the protagonist must confront the main obstacle directly. The outcome of this confrontation determines whether they will achieve their goal.
5. **Design the Resolution (and New Equilibrium):** Show the aftermath of the climax. The character has either succeeded or failed, and as a result, they are fundamentally changed. A new, different state of equilibrium is established.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "What does the character want, and what is stopping them from getting it?"
- "How does this event force the character to make a difficult choice?"
- "Is this obstacle more challenging than the last one?"
- "What is the central question that the climax of the plot will answer?"
- "How is the character different at the end of the story compared to the beginning?"
