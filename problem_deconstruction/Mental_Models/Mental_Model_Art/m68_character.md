## Mental Model = Character

**Category = Art**
**Description:** 
A character is the vehicle through which an audience experiences a story. More than a simple collection of traits, a compelling character is a bundle of desires, contradictions, and motivations that drive their choices. Plot reveals character by forcing them to act under pressure, and in turn, the character's choices determine the direction of the plot. The ultimate purpose of a story is often to witness the transformation of its central character.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **In Abstract or Conceptual Art:** In works that are purely about form, color, or ideas, a traditional character can be an unnecessary and distracting element.
- **When Characters Become Stereotypes:** A character defined by a single trait (the "wise old man," the "damsel in distress") is not a character but a caricature. This should be avoided unless used intentionally for commentary or satire.

**Keywords for Situations:** 
Leadership, team building, product design (user personas), creative writing, acting, personal development.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Define the Core Desire:** What does the character want more than anything else? This desire will be the engine for their actions.
2. **Identify the Central Flaw or Misbelief:** What is the fundamental flaw in their thinking or personality that is holding them back? (e.g., arrogance, fear, selfishness). The plot will challenge this flaw.
3. **Establish a Voice:** How does the character speak? What are their mannerisms and habits? Their voice should be distinct and consistent.
4. **Make Them Act:** Don't just tell the audience what a character is like; show them through the choices the character makes, especially when those choices are difficult.
5. **Create a Character Arc:** How does the character change from the beginning of the story to the end? They should be transformed by their journey, either by overcoming their flaw or being consumed by it.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "What is this character's deepest desire, and what are they willing to do to get it?"
- "What is the contradiction at the heart of this character?"
- "If we removed this character from the story, would the plot still happen?"
- "How can we show the audience this character's personality instead of just telling them?"
- "What is the most difficult decision this character has to make, and what does it reveal about them?"
