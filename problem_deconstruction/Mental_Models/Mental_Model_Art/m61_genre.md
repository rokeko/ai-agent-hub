## Mental Model = Genre

**Category = Art**
**Description:** 
Genre is a set of conventions and expectations that act as an unspoken agreement between the artist and the audience. It's a system of classification that provides a framework for both creating and interpreting art. Far from being a mere label, genre provides the rules of the game, giving the artist a foundation to build upon, subvert, or deconstruct, while setting the initial context for the audience's experience.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When Aiming for Pure Innovation:** If the goal is to create something entirely new that defies categorization, consciously working against genre conventions is necessary. Adhering to a genre can limit radical creativity.
- **In the Final Stages of Refinement:** Over-focusing on "does this fit the genre?" can lead to formulaic work. At a certain point, the work must be judged on its own merits, not just its adherence to a category.

**Keywords for Situations:** 
Storytelling, music composition, filmmaking, product marketing, branding, creative writing.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Identify the Dominant Genre:** What are the primary conventions you are working with? (e.g., in a film, is it a romantic comedy, a thriller, a documentary?).
2. **List the Core Expectations:** What does the audience expect from this genre? A mystery needs a puzzle, a comedy needs humor, a tragedy needs catharsis.
3. **Choose Your Stance: Conform, Subvert, or Blend?**
    - **Conform:** Master the rules and deliver a classic, satisfying experience.
    - **Subvert:** Intentionally break the established rules to surprise the audience and challenge their expectations.
    - **Blend:** Combine elements from different genres to create a new, hybrid form.
4. **Use Conventions as a Shorthand:** Leverage genre tropes to communicate ideas efficiently, allowing you to spend more time on the unique aspects of your work.
5. **Evolve the Genre:** How can you add to the conversation of the genre? Every new work has the potential to slightly alter the boundaries and definitions of its category for future artists.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "What genre are we operating in, and what are the audience's expectations?"
- "Are we using these genre conventions as a crutch or as a springboard?"
- "What happens if we deliberately do the opposite of what the genre expects here?"
- "How can we satisfy the audience's desire for the familiar while still offering them something new?"
- "If we had to invent a new genre name for this work, what would it be?"
