## Mental Model = Setting

**Category = Art**
**Description:** 
Setting is the time, place, and social context in which a story occurs. It is not a passive backdrop but an active participant that shapes the characters' choices, conflicts, and possibilities. The setting provides both the physical environment and the underlying rules—cultural, historical, and social—that govern the narrative. It is the "where" and "when" that profoundly influences the "why."

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **In Universally Themed Fables:** For stories that aim to be timeless and placeless parables, a highly specific setting can detract from the universal message.
- **When It Overwhelms the Story:** If the description of the setting is so detailed and elaborate that it overshadows the characters and plot, the story can become a static travelogue rather than a dynamic narrative.

**Keywords for Situations:** 
World-building, event planning, retail store design, architectural design, historical fiction, workplace culture.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Define the Macro and Micro Settings:** What is the broad context (e.g., a futuristic dystopia, medieval Europe) and the specific, immediate location (e.g., a grimy alley, a grand ballroom)?
2. **Establish the "Rules" of the Setting:** What are the physical, social, and cultural laws of this place? What is considered normal? What is forbidden? These rules create conflict.
3. **Use Setting to Reveal Character:** How does a character react to their environment? Their comfort or discomfort, their ability to navigate or their feeling of being trapped, reveals who they are.
4. **Make the Setting a Force of Antagonism:** The setting itself can be an obstacle. A harsh desert, an oppressive cityscape, or a rigid social structure can be the primary source of conflict for the protagonist.
5. **Show, Don't Just Tell:** Instead of describing the setting in a block of text, weave the details into the action. Show the crumbling bricks, the smell of rain, the sound of distant sirens, as the character experiences them.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "How does this specific location limit or empower the character?"
- "What are the 'unwritten rules' of this place, and what happens if a character breaks them?"
- "If this setting were a character, what would its personality be?"
- "How can we use the weather or the time of day to amplify the mood of this scene?"
- "What details in this environment can the character use to their advantage or be hindered by?"
