## Mental Model = Representation

**Category = Art**
**Description:** 
Representation is the act of using a symbol, image, or story to stand in for something else. It is the fundamental process of abstracting reality into a communicable form. Because we cannot grasp the full complexity of the world, we create representations—maps, words, data visualizations, paintings—to make it understandable, navigable, and meaningful. Every representation is an interpretation that highlights certain aspects of reality while obscuring others.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When Mistaking it for Reality:** The primary danger is forgetting that the representation is not the thing it represents (see "The Map Is Not the Territory"). Decisions based solely on a representation without consulting the underlying reality can be disastrous.
- **When a Representation is Over-Simplified:** A representation that is too simplistic can strip out crucial nuance, leading to stereotypes, flawed strategies, and a poor understanding of the situation.

**Keywords for Situations:** 
Data visualization, brand identity, political messaging, scientific modeling, user interface design, filmmaking.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Identify the "Territory":** What is the underlying reality, object, or concept you are trying to represent?
2. **Define the Purpose of the Representation:** What do you want this representation to _do_? Should it persuade, inform, simplify, or evoke an emotion? The purpose determines the form.
3. **Choose the Medium and its Rules:** Will you use words, images, sounds, or data? Each medium has its own strengths, weaknesses, and inherent biases. A photograph represents differently than a poem.
4. **Acknowledge What is Left Out:** Be conscious of what your representation excludes or minimizes. This act of selection is where the representation's bias and power lies.
5. **Test for Misinterpretation:** How might an audience misunderstand this representation? What false conclusions could they draw? Refine the representation to make its scope and limitations clearer.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "What reality is this image/story/data point representing?"
- "What is being emphasized here, and, more importantly, what is being ignored?"
- "Could this same reality be represented in a completely different way? What would that look like?"
- "Who does this representation serve?"
- "What are the potential dangers of someone mistaking this representation for the literal truth?"
