## Mental Model = Framing

**Category = Art**
**Description:** 
Framing is the art of controlling context to influence perception. It is the lens through which an idea, story, or image is presented. By carefully selecting what to emphasize, what to exclude, and what to associate with the subject, an artist can shape the audience's emotional and intellectual response. The frame doesn't change the facts, but it changes the meaning the audience derives from them.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When Unbiased Analysis is Required:** In scientific research, intelligence analysis, or journalistic reporting, the goal is often to remove frames, not impose them, to see the raw data as clearly as possible.
- **When a Frame is Deceptive:** Using a frame to intentionally mislead or manipulate an audience for unethical gain is a breach of trust. The power of framing comes with a responsibility to be truthful.

**Keywords for Situations:** 
Marketing, political communication, negotiation, filmmaking, photography, user experience design.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Identify the Core Message:** What is the central idea or product you are presenting?
2. **Determine the Desired Perception:** How do you want the audience to feel or think about this message? (e.g., as an urgent problem, a luxury item, a call to adventure).
3. **Choose the Frame:** Select the context, language, and imagery that will evoke that desired perception.
    - **Loss Aversion Frame:** People are more motivated to avoid a loss than to acquire a gain. Frame your message in terms of what the audience stands to lose.
    - **Value Frame:** Frame the message around shared values like family, freedom, or innovation.
    - **Metaphorical Frame:** Use a powerful metaphor to simplify a complex idea (e.g., "war on drugs," "information superhighway").
4. **Define the Boundaries:** What are you intentionally leaving out of the frame? What are you highlighting? Ensure this selection process serves to clarify, not deceive.
5. **Test the Frame:** Present the framed message to a test audience. Does it have the intended effect? Does it feel authentic? Be prepared to adjust the frame based on feedback.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "What is the current frame around this issue, and is it serving us?"
- "How would our perspective change if we framed this as an opportunity instead of a threat?"
- "What language and images are we using, and what unspoken assumptions do they carry?"
- "Who benefits from this particular frame being accepted?"
- "What are we choosing _not_ to show in this picture?"
