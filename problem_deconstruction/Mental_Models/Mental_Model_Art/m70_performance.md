## Mental Model = Performance

**Category = Art**
**Description:** 
Performance is the practice of executing a task with skill and presence in a specific moment. It is the art of the ephemeral, where the action itself, rather than a physical artifact, is the work. A performance is a live, embodied event that is unique to its time and place, and its meaning is co-created by the performer's actions and the audience's active presence and interpretation.

**When to Avoid (or Use with Caution):**
- **When a Permanent Record is Essential:** If the primary goal is to create a fixed, repeatable, and perfectly polished product, the inherent variability and ephemerality of live performance can be a liability.
- **When Preparation is Lacking:** A poor performance can do more damage to a reputation than no performance at all. The vulnerability of the live moment requires rigorous practice and preparation.

**Keywords for Situations:** 
Public speaking, surgery, sports, musical concerts, negotiations, crisis management.

**Thinking Steps:**
1. **Define the Goal:** What is the intended outcome of the performance? Is it to persuade, entertain, heal, or achieve a specific target?
2. **Master the Craft (Practice):** Performance is built on a foundation of deep, repetitive practice until the core skills become second nature. This frees the performer to be present in the moment.
3. **Embrace the Ephemeral (Presence):** During the performance, let go of the rigid plan and respond to the live environment. Be fully present and adapt to the unexpected.
4. **Engage the Audience:** Acknowledge the presence of the audience (or stakeholders). Their energy and feedback are part of the event. Create a feedback loop with them.
5. **Review and Reflect:** Since a performance cannot be perfectly replicated, the learning happens after the event. Reflect on what worked, what didn't, and how the context influenced the outcome.

**Coaching Questions:**
- "What is the single most important thing we want the audience to feel or do as a result of this performance?"
- "Have we practiced enough that we can stop thinking about the mechanics and start focusing on the meaning?"
- "What are the potential points of failure, and how can we prepare for them?"
- "How are we creating a connection with our audience, rather than just talking at them?"
- "What did we learn from that performance that we can apply to the next one?"
