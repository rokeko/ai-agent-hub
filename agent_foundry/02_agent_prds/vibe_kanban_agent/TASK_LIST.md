# Task List: Vibe Kanban Agent

This task list breaks down the process of building the "Vibe Kanban" agent into a set of concrete, actionable steps.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality (Prototype)

*   **1.1. Setup Project Structure:**
    *   [ ] Create a new directory for the agent in `agent_foundry/`.
    *   [ ] Initialize a new Node.js project with `npm init`.
    *   [ ] Install necessary dependencies (`express`, `axios`, etc.).
*   **1.2. Obsidian Integration (Manual Ingestion):**
    *   [ ] Create a script to read the content of a specified directory in the user's Obsidian vault.
    *   [ ] For the prototype, we will manually trigger this script.
*   **1.3. Content Transformation (Basic):**
    *   [ ] Create a simple templating engine to transform the ingested content into a basic HTML format.
*   **1.4. Kanban Board (Basic):**
    *   [ ] Create a simple web page to display the transformed content in a basic Kanban board format (e.g., using CSS Grid or Flexbox).
*   **1.5. Squarespace Integration (Manual Publication):**
    *   [ ] Create a script to manually post the transformed content to a Squarespace blog.
    *   [ ] For the prototype, we will manually trigger this script.

## Phase 2: Automation and Integration

*   **2.1. Obsidian Integration (Automated Ingestion):**
    *   [ ] Implement a file system watcher to automatically detect changes in the user's Obsidian vault.
    *   [ ] Trigger the content ingestion process when a change is detected.
*   **2.2. Squarespace Integration (Automated Publication):**
    *   [ ] Implement a mechanism to automatically post the transformed content to Squarespace when a card is moved to a "Ready to Publish" column on the Kanban board.
*   **2.3. Authentication and Security:**
    *   [ ] Implement secure authentication for the Squarespace API.
    *   [ ] Implement secure authentication for the Kanban board (if necessary).

## Phase 3: Rich Visual Experience

*   **3.1. Kanban Board (Vibe Kanban Inspired):**
    *   [ ] Design and implement a visually rich and engaging Kanban board, inspired by Vibe Kanban.
    *   [ ] Use a modern front-end framework (e.g., React, Vue.js) to build the Kanban board.
*   **3.2. Content Transformation (Advanced):**
    *   [ ] Implement a more advanced templating engine to support a wider range of content types and formats.
    *   [ ] Add support for images, videos, and other media.

## Phase 4: Cost Tracking and Metrics

*   **4.1. Cost Tracking:**
    *   [ ] Implement a mechanism to track the costs associated with the user's workflow.
    *   [ ] Display the cost information on the Kanban board.
*   **4.2. Metrics and Analytics:**
    *   [ ] Implement a mechanism to track and to display other metrics, such as the number of posts published, the time spent on each task, etc.

## Phase 5: Mobile Experience

*   **5.1. Mobile-First Design:**
    *   [ ] Design and implement a mobile-first version of the Kanban board.
    *   [ ] The mobile experience should be minimalist and elegant, prioritizing the most essential information.
