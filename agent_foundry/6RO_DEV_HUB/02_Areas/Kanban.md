You're spot onâ€”embedding a Kanban view can bring major clarity to both agent design in your development hub and task execution within your vault. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown tailored to your 6RO setup:

## ðŸŽ¯ A) Kanban for **6RO LangFlow or Agent Design (DEV_HUB)**

While you sketch agent interactions in `03_flow_sketches/`, adding a Kanban board provides structured visibility into PRD, task progress, and flow stages.

- Use the **Obsidian Kanban plugin** (by mgmeyers) to create markdown-backed boards directly within your dev notes ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/supercharge-your-project-management-obsidian-deep-forero-martinez-rrkje?utm_source=chatgpt.com "A Deep Dive into Kanban Boards and Note Linking"), [obsidianstats.com](https://www.obsidianstats.com/plugins/obsidian-kanban?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Create markdown-backed Kanban boards in Obsidian."))
    
- Create columns such as **PRD Draft**, **Flow Sketch**, **Prototype**, **Validation**, **Done**
    
- Link cards to `.md` flow and PRD notes via inline links
    
- As you complete agent tasks (PRD â†’ Task â†’ Flow), move the card along the board
    

**Benefits**:

- Makes work visible across agent design pipeline
    
- Helps track WIP limits (only 1-2 agents in progress at once)
    
- Encourages completion before launching next agent iteration ([MPU Talk](https://talk.macpowerusers.com/t/kanban-boards-how-do-they-help/28888?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Kanban Boards - how do they help? - Software - MPU Talk"))

## ðŸ“‚ B) Kanban for **Obsidian 6RO Vault Tasks & Workflows**

Within your `Vault_System_Overview`, `PRD_Task_Index`, or `Agent_Dashboard`, a Kanban board nicely complements Dataview dashboards.

- Create a note `Dashboards/Agent_Kanban.md` using the Kanban plugin
    
- Use frontmatter `status::` on your task or agent notes, e.g.:
    
    ```yaml
    status: To Do
    project: Ambassador Agent
    ```
    
- In your Kanban board:
    
    ````markdown
    ```kanban
    title: Agent Workflow
    columns:
      - To Do
      - In Progress
      - Done
    query: task
    ````
    
- Move cards by changing the `status::` in notes or dragging them
    

**Advantages**:

- Visual view of your active agents, PRDs, task progress, broken down by pillar
    
- Extends Dataview dashboards with actionable controls
    
- Links cards to the rich content notes you already maintain ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/supercharge-your-project-management-obsidian-deep-forero-martinez-rrkje?utm_source=chatgpt.com "A Deep Dive into Kanban Boards and Note Linking"))

## ðŸ§  Kanban + MCP (Model Context Protocol) Potential

- MVP use case: Use **Kanban MCP server** or **MCP Tasks** (task-ticket CRUD) to expose Kanban boards via LLM agent UI (e.g., in Claude Desktop) ([LobeHub](https://lobehub.com/mcp/rafael09ed-kanban-mcp?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Kanban MCP | MCP Servers"))
    
- With **MCP Tools plugin**, AI assistants like Claude could read back your Kanban board, update status, or add tasks directly from conversation context ([GitHub](https://github.com/jacksteamdev/obsidian-mcp-tools?utm_source=chatgpt.com "jacksteamdev/obsidian-mcp-tools"))

## ðŸ“Œ Summary Comparison

|Use Case|Tool/Feature|Purpose|
|---|---|---|
|Agent Design Pipeline|Obsidian Kanban plugin|Map stages across PRD â†’ Flow â†’ Done|
|Vault-wide insight|Kanban board + Dataview|Visualize PRDs and tasks with real context|
|AI-managed tasks (future)|Kanban MCP server, MCP Tools|Enable AI to read/update Kanban content|

## ðŸš€ Next Steps Demo

1. **Install Obsidian Kanban plugin** if not already
    
2. Create a note in DEV_HUB, e.g. `Flow_Kanban.md`:
    
    ````markdown
    ```kanban
    title: Agent Pipeline
    columns: [To Do, Flow, Prototype, Done]
    ````
    
3. Add tasks/cards like:  
    `[[PRD_SocialButler_Agent]] â€“ Write summary`
    
4. In Vault, do similar with task cards and backlinks to PRD details
    
5. Optionally tag with `#agent #task` for Dataview querying

If you'd like, I can auto-generate a starter Kanban note (`Agent_Kanban.md`) with templated columns and quick card links based on your current agent PRD notes. Let me know!
