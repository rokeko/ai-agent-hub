# ðŸ§± 6RO_DEV_HUB â€“ Google Drive Integration Guide

This folder mirrors your Obsidian vault structure into a GTD-inspired hierarchy using PARA (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive).

## Folder Descriptions

- **01_Projects**: Active agent builds, workshops, decks.
- **02_Areas**: Long-running workstreams (e.g. Sales GTM, 6RO Ambassador System).
- **03_Resources**: Reusable components, research, templates.
- **04_Archive**: Archived ideas, completed projects.

You can use this layout for:
- VS Code & GitHub sync (project folders)
- Langflow file references
- Google Drive storage + sharing
- Gemini / AI-assisted workflows

All Obsidian vault references (from your 6RO_MOC) can be linked via this spine.
